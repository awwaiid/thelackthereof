Cute.  When I was casting about for a name for my biz, I considered TIARA Systems (TIARA standing for TIARA Is A Recursive Acronym), and TINARA Systems (This Is Not A Recursive Acronym).  The original name, back in 1990, was TIDMADT Enterprises, after something I had dreamed up for a license plate long before I had my first car: These Initials Don't Mean A Damn Thing.  And yes, when I got my first car, I got that custom plate, and when I started a BBS a couple years later, named it that.
