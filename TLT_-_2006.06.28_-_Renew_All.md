I just got a late notice from the [http://www.phoenixpubliclibrary.org/ Phoenix Public Library]. Being overdue on my library books, movies, and anything similar is a long family tradition handed down from generation to generation. One of the only things that could keep Mom from taking us to the library is not being able to find enough spare change to pay for the fines.

Therefore... cpan:WWW::Mechanize to the rescue!

<code>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use WWW::Mechanize;

my $card = '21730033605848';
my $lastname = 'wilcox';

my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new( autocheck => 1 );
$agent->get('http://www.phoenixpubliclibrary.org/login.jsp');
$agent->form_number(3);
$agent->current_form->value('libcard', $card);
$agent->current_form->value('lastname', $lastname);
$agent->submit();
$agent->submit();
$agent->follow(qr((?-xism:Renew\sAll)));
print $agent->content;
$agent->follow(qr((?-xism:Exit)));
</code>

Stick that in your pipe and smoke it. Or maybe a cron job.
