Describe the new page here.

In the "other comments" section of an NAU parking services survey:
-----
Two crazy ideas:

(1) Don't sell more parking stickers than you have parking spaces<br>
(2) Give everyone one single assigned spot

And a bonus (in the case that you don't do the above, which I'm sure you won't):

(3) Only ticket people when they are consuming resources in a way that limit those who have paid. In other words, don't ticket someone who is parked in an otherwise empty parking lot without the correct sticker. The only reason this is done is to make money, and if you want more money it should come from an increase in tuition not an evil plot to suck money out of the student population one ticket at a time. This back-handed way of getting funding is ethically wrong and you should be ashamed of yourselves.

I suspect they will ignore me. Hopefully they will get a good laugh out of it :)

I should fix my comment pages. I broke them when I added my QuestionAsker extension. hrm.
