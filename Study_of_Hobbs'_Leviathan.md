We've started a book club to study political philosophy, and are starting with Hobbs. Here are some random notes.

=== Chapter 6 ===
Defines lots of vocabulary, including Good and Evil.

Starts to build a language to talk about the state of nature.

=== Chapter 7 ===
About the goals of discourse.

Science vs Opinion.

=== Chapter 8 ===


=== Chapter 9 ===


=== Chapter 10 ===
Power, hounour
