Since that article is not in the top section, it was probably up for a short amount of time. I wonder how many Reddit users go there every day (I do). It may have only linked a handful of people to that essay.

I like Reddit a lot. Since finding the site, I've got over my Slashdot habit. I find that the entries are of much higher quality than Slashdot.
