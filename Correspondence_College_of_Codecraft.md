Greetings! Welcome to The Lack Thereof Correspondence College of Coding. This program is a customized self-study system for learning the art and science of computer programming and related technology. We take the unique approach of utilizing traditional "snail" mail for delivery of lessons, though we do offer feedback and other elements via electronic means.

== Why Snail Mail? ==

Good question! Modern internet-based lessons, even many modern books, offer the source code for the lesson in a digital form. While it is convenient for the student to copy-paste or directly save the sample code for the lesson, we feel that the act of manually typing the lesson in allows the pupil's fingers to learn what it feels like to write a program.

It isn't possible to enter a program, either one received through correspondence or one of your own design, without mistakes. As the student finds and fixes mistakes they will learn one of the most essential aspects of programming -- debugging.

== What about advanced lessons? ==

Currently the college is only offering beginning lessons. As our student base advances we will continuously consider the most appropriate mechanisem to best push their knowledge forward. But for now we are starting with snail mail correspondence.

== What language do you teach? ==

Currently we teach Perl, but we are happy to consider other languages and technologies depending on student interest and needs.

== How do I apply? ==

Please send an email to awwaiid@thelackthereof.org describing your interests and current level of knowledge. Please provide us with enough information to get a feel for your level of commitment. We will evaluate your application and decide within two weeks if we are an appropriate match for one another.

== How much does it cost? ==

We work on a sliding scale depending on the student. Please indicate in your application what rate you believe fits with your current situation.

== I have more questions! ==

Please email awwaiid@thelackthereof.org and we'll do our best to answer!
