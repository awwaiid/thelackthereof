Hey Brock:

I came to your web page through Linkedin.  We are both connected to Stevan Little.  I am looking for uncommonly obsessed Perl developers for a few  software development organizations which march to the beat of a different drummer.  

I have found there are two kinds of software developers.  There are people who thought computer science would be a nice career, went to school, got a degree, and specialize in whatever languages they were pushed into by their first and subsequent jobs.  These people are boring.  

Then there are the mutant programming freaks like you.  People who contribute to CPAN, keep blogs, and dream in code.  People driven by passion and creativity who use the technical stuff to break barriers.  These are the people I get jobs for.  I work with software development companies that are full of people like you and are looking for more. I find this infinitely more rewarding than working with the former types.   

Can we arrange a call to discuss?  I want to learn about your personal and professional objectives.  I will use my notes to keep you aware of openings with these types of companies that may fit. 

Thanks!

DAVE

Greetings Dave!

How about you shoot me an email (awwaiid@thelackthereof.org) with your contact information? I don't intend to be on the open job market any time soon... but you never know! If nothing else I can call you if I ever need some sort of self affirmation :)
