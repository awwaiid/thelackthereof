[[Deep Thoughts]] of the day: What will they call paperwork when there is no more paper?

Finally communicated with Dima today. Said he would be able to tell me something difinitive on Friday. Good news... having a timeline is good. Hopefully he will hire me and then Beth can come out and we can get going. I feel like I'm in purgatory... hard to do since the Catholics threw it out.

Everything Zen.

I'm trying out the EditCSS extension for FireFox and would ust like to say that IT ROCKS. Oh... and this is the 42nd TLT-wiki entry! It's a magical day!
