The LaTeX extension on the oddmuse site is a bit screwy, isn't it? I noticed that the comments refer to a program dvi2bitmap, whereas the actual program used is called dvi2png; whereas the program is in fact called dvipng.

Also the formulas seem not to render correctly. I.e. having $$a+b$$ would not do the trick... Is this an issue or am I the only one experiencing this?

This is a tricky extension to make work... it took me several tries and some customization to make it do exactly what I wanted. It works alright... but it is not very self-diagnosing, so when something is wrong it doesn't tell you. I had to just go through a bit at a time until I figured it all out.

This page has been recently updated, now the extension is much easier to install (thanks to the author, Todd Neal). $$e^x$$ four-ever!!
