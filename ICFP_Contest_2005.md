This is to help coordinate efforts on the ICFP Contest 2005.

I'm almost done implementing the protocol and state machines. I switched languages from Ocaml to Python in the middle, which added a few hours on. I am, however, using a different style in Python than I would normally have used. 

After I get done with the stuff mentioned above I'm going to set up the graph data structure. Then I'll work on the AI. I'll probably just use some fuzzy logic. I don't know whether I'll have time for minimax (which I have zero experience with).
