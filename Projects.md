For a raw directory view of my projects, see the [TLT:projects/ projects directory].  The raw view is sorted roughly by language... but it is difficult from the direct listings to figure out which projects are worth looking at. Thus I present here a list of programming-related projects, and the tools and languages I might use to create them.

== Current Projects ==
If you were to ask me what I'm working on right now, I might say one of these.
* [[Continuity]] - Continuation-based web-application framework for Perl
* [[EPFarms Panel]] - A control panel for hosting clients
* [[Perl HtmlUnit]] - A perl interface to the java HtmlUnit library
* [[Scrutiny Debugger]] - PSGI/Plack Middleware providing a debugger

== Backburner ==
If you had asked me what I was working on last week, or if you ask me next week, I might mention one of these.
* [[An Introduction to Programming via Perl]]
* [[CGI Inspect]] - Inspect running CGI apps
* [[Chompie]] - Chop a program to pieces
* [[OGPF]] - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework
* [[Polly]] - A very simple perl wrapper around some command-line audio players
* [[Rubik's Cube Solver]] - I finally got my very own Rubik's Cube!
* [[Skechiki]] - A Perl/GTK sketchbook for small touch-screen devices
* [[Use Everywhere]] - Use a perl module all over the place
* [[VladimirBot]] - Personal assistant bot
* [[Web Board Games]] - Web based 2D board games

== Inactive ==
I probably won't be doing much with these. This ''could'' mean that they are in a fairly completed state. It could also mean that they are abandoned. But feel free to ask me about them anyway!
* [[Caravan]] - OCaml implementation of the sequential data mining algorithms
