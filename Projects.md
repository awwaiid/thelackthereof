For a raw directory view of my projects, see the [TLT:projects/ projects directory].  The raw view is sorted roughly by language... but it is difficult from the direct listings to figure out which projects are worth looking at. Thus I present here a list of programming-related projects, and the tools and languages I might use to create them.

== Current Projects ==
If you were to ask me what I'm working on right now, I might say one of these.
* [[EPFarms Panel]] - A control panel for hosting clients
* [[Continuity]] - Continuation-based web-application framework for Perl
* [[OGPF]] - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework
* [[Oddmuse EditSection]] - Edit things on a per-section basis in oddmuse
== Backburner ==
If you had asked me what I was working on last week, or if you ask me next week, I might mention one of these.
* [[Contize]] - Provide a perl object with a way to fake continuations
* [[SetDB]] - A set-theoretical datbase interface
* [[GOE]] - Smalltalk-like environment for Perl
* [[VladimirBot]] - Personal assistant bot
* [[An Introduction to Programming via Perl]]

== Inactive ==
I probably won't be doing much with these. This ''could'' mean that they are in a fairly completed state. It could also mean that they are abandonded.
* [[OCaml GrabBag]] - Datastructure for a random-retrieval collection
* [[OddMuse Pingback]] - A pingback server for oddmuse comment pages
* [[OCaml Eval]] - Evaluate OCaml code dynamically
* [[Graph Module]] - OddMuse plugin to make GraphViz graphs

== Tools ==
* [[I love Vim]] - my chosen IDE
* See a [[Screenshot on 2003.10.17]]
* [[Darcs]] - revision/branch management. It's fun.

== Languages ==
* http://www.perl.org - Perl
* http://caml.inria.fr - OCaml
* http://gcc.gnu.org - C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, ...
* http://squeak.org - Squeak SmallTalk
* http://java.sun.com - Evil Java
