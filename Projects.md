For a raw directory view of my projects, see the [TLT:projects/ projects directory].  The raw view is sorted roughly by language... but it is difficult from the direct listings to figure out which projects are worth looking at. Thus I present here a list of programming-related projects, and the tools and languages I might use to create them.

== Current Projects ==
If you were to ask me what I'm working on right now, I might say one of these.
* [[Openmoko]] - Customizing the Open Phone
* [[WayV]] - Building on Mike Bennett's gesture recognition app
* [[Continuity]] - Continuation-based web-application framework for Perl
* [[EPFarms Panel]] - A control panel for hosting clients
* [[CGI Inspect]] - Inspect running CGI apps
* [[Perl HtmlUnit]] - A perl interface to the java HtmlUnit library

== Backburner ==
If you had asked me what I was working on last week, or if you ask me next week, I might mention one of these.
* [[GOE]] - Smalltalk-like environment for Perl
* [[VladimirBot]] - Personal assistant bot
* [[An Introduction to Programming via Perl]]
* [[OGPF]] - OCaml Genetic Programming Framework
* [[Oddmuse EditSection]] - Edit things on a per-section basis in oddmuse
* [[Gecko-based html2ps]] - Render html -> postscript using the gecko 
* [[SetDB]] - A set-theoretical datbase interface
* [[DHTML Combo]] - A combo box made using DHTML/Javascript
* [[Oddmuse Ref Links]] - Module for a sidebar list of incoming links for a page
* [[Oddmuse Search Tags]] - Module for a simple tagging mechanism
* [[Polly]] - A very simple perl wrapper around some command-line audio players
* [[Dot2html]] - Convert graphviz files to HTML and Javascript
* [[MobileFS]] - Fuse filesystem to cache files for mobile reading
* [[Chompie]] - Chop a program to pieces
* [[Oddmuse Editfile]] - Edit a file (especially perl) through oddmuse
* [[JQuery Autoindent]] - I've always wanted a textbox that auto-indents
* [[Rubik's Cube Solver]] - I finally got my very own Rubik's Cube!
* [[Web Board Games]] - Web based 2D board games

== Inactive ==
I probably won't be doing much with these. This ''could'' mean that they are in a fairly completed state. It could also mean that they are abandoned.
* [[OCaml GrabBag]] - Datastructure for a random-retrieval collection (complete)
* [[OddMuse Pingback]] - A pingback server for oddmuse comment pages (abandonded)
* [[OCaml Eval]] - Evaluate OCaml code dynamically (complete, old)
* [[Graph Module]] - OddMuse plugin to make GraphViz graphs (complete)
* [[The Fridge]] - A javascript/php refrigerator (complete)
* [[Zend Hacking]] - Feeling my way around (abandonded)
* [[Contize]] - Provide a perl object with a way to fake continuations (complete and abandonded)
* [[MHTML]] - An HTML (XML?) Macro language (complete? old)
* [[Untyped Lambda Calculus in OCaml]] - Exactly what it sounds like (complete? old)
* [[Census Data Extraction]] - Small project to help a researcher correlate some data
