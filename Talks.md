From time to time I give talks on various topics. Audiences range from the local Perl Monger group to larger conferences. Unfortunately for you, I prefer to do crazy things like live code demos and use minimalist slides, so you don't quote get the same effect from these records. Hopefully I can dig up some videos :)

== Introduction to Debugging Perl ==
* DCBPW 2012
* More talk about Science!

== Art and Science of Debugging ==
* PPW 2011
* Lots of talk about Science!

== Testing The Interactive Web ==
* Presented at: [http://www.perloasis.info/opw2011/ Orlando Perl Workshop (Perl Oasis) 2011.01.15]
* [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/oasis-2011/ Source Code]
* [http://www.presentingperl.org/opw2011/testing-the-interactive-web/ Video recording of the presentation]

<blockquote>In this talk, I will teach the audience the basics of using WWW::HtmlUnit (and WWW::HtmlUnit::Sweet) for scraping and testing javascript-required web applications. We'll go over installation, basic usage, and some real-world examples. The WWW::HtmlUnit module uses the java-based HtmlUnit library, which itself builds off of a suite of libraries including Rhino to simulate a web browser. Among many other useful features, it can execute complex javascript -- it passes the jQuery test suite perfectly, for example. Bringing that power to Perl has allowed developers to go well beyond what WWW::Mechanize can simulate, while avoiding the overhead of a full Selenium setup.</blockquote>

== Read Eval PLAY Loop ==
* Presented at: [http://pghpw.org/ppw2010/ PPW 2010.10.10]
* [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/ppw-2010/ppw2010-repl-presentation.pdf Slides (pdf)]

<blockquote>Harking back to the days of yore, in this talk we seek to reclaim that elusive touchpoint between man and machine. That spot oh so sweet wherein you type out magic incantations and watch as the figures on the screen flash and bounce, obeying your every whim... line and color meet, curving and spinning into a rainbow star of power and mystery!</blockquote>

== WWW::HtmlUnit - Perl Interface to the Java library ==
* Presented at: [http://yapc10.org/yn2009/ YAPC::NA 2009.06.24]
* [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/yapc-2009/htmlunit/ Source Code]

<blockquote>The mighty WWW::Mechanize is fantastic... right up until you have to deal with some javascript. The HtmlUnit project has build on the Mozilla Rhino engine to create a browser agent that works even against complex javascript. It passes the JQuery test suite, as an example of it's powers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We will present the Perl interface to the HtmlUnit library, setting you on the path to scraping and testing those javascript-dependent sites that you've being eying for so long.</blockquote>

== A Web-Based Inspector for (CGI?) Perl Applications ==
* Presented at: [http://yapc10.org/yn2009/ YAPC::NA 2009.06.24]
* [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/yapc-2009/cgi-inspect/ Source Code]

<blockquote>One of the tried and true ways of debugging is to sprinkle 'print "Here! $val\n"' around and see what happens or if the program even reaches that point. Simple and effective! Carp::REPL lets you take this a step further by starting an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) at an arbitrary point in your program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I've taken this technique and mixed in a splash of Continuity to build an interactive web-based REPL and inspector for your application. The REPL lets you execute arbitrary code, the inspector gives you a GUI for traversing your callstack and manipulating your variables. It works on regular applications and CGI scripts too. You just add a single "inspect()" where you like and you'll be whackin' those bugs DOWN!</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this talk I'll show you how to use the tool and how it's built... and how you can add to it with plugins.</blockquote>
