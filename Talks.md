From time to time I give talks on various topics, usually Perl related. Audiences range from the local Perl Monger group to larger conferences. A significant disadvantage of this list is that my favorite thing to do is live code demos... which don't show up on slides. Maybe I'll see if I can find videos.

(This is just an outline, abstracts and links to slides will be backfilled)
