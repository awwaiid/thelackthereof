Intell in Apples doesn't really bug me.  They make reasonably good CPU's and I think Apple /still/ suffers from "Not enough MHZ" symdrom in the consumer market place.  Further, while the Power4 is a really f'ing nice chip, it was never on the radar for my next cpu, even with real vector instructions.  Dual opterion running linux *mmmmmm*.

Too many people know just enough to have been taught by Intell that MHZ is all.
