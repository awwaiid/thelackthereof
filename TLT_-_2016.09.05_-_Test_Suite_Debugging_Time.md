One of the codebases I work on regularly has a large and slow test suite. So slow that it typically only runs in totality in a continuous-integration environment, and there it uses the [https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests parallel_tests gem] to slice it into pieces and run in parallel. This gets it to run in like 30 minutes instead of 2.5 hours.

But I want to run the whole thing linearly sometimes, especially so I can make sure tests aren't conflicting with each other. So I created a new ci job that runs it linearly ... and got a fail that I didn't get otherwise. Took forever to figure it out!

This was about a worker that I call a "sweeper" -- it's job is to run once a day and make sure nothing was missed by other realtime jobs during the day. Here is a simplified version.

<code>
class SweeperWorker
  INTERVAL = 25.hours.ago # Overlap by an hour
  def perform
    candidates.each(&:do_work) # something like that
  end
  def candidates
    Thing.where('created_at > ?', INTERVAL)
  end
end

# rspec
describe SweeperWorker do
  let(:new_thing) { Thing.new(created_at: 5.hours.ago) }
  let(:old_thing) { Thing.new(created_at: 25.hours.ago) }

  it "does pick up the new thing" do
    new_thing # force to exist
    expect(SweeperWorker.new.candidates).to include(new_thing)
  end

  it "does not pick up the old thing" do
    old_thing # force to exist
    expect(SweeperWorker.new.candidates).not_to include(old_thing)
  end
end
</code>

Not sure that is quite right, but you should get the idea.

The second example was failing -- both the "old thing" and the "new thing" were getting into the sweeper window -- but only when the test suite was run linearly. Run it in ci, no problem. Run just this test locally, no problem.

The suspect is thus time -- but where? I went down the wrong track for a while, looking into timezones. Rails vs MySQL on ci vs my machine and so on ... some of those things weren't quite matched up, but still.

Finally I got it! Right there in the first line of SweeperWorker:

<code>
INTERVAL = 25.hours.ago # Overlap by an hour
</code>

This constant is set when the class is loaded, and never changed! So by the time this test runs in the 2.5 hours of test time, 25 hours ago is now 27.5 hours ago -- so our "old" thing is in our window. And now we can sing our victory song!

Lesson learned: Don't put things you want to be dynamic/relative into a constant. Duh.
