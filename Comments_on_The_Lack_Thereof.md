Hi, I run a couple of Oddmuse wikis, one at home and the other in the intranet at the office. I like your site's layout anc CSS, do you make it available? I was just looking for an central area plus sidebar arrangement.

AFAICS, you can steal the style from the source of the generated HTML and put into your oddmuse...

Yeah, I had email contact with Jan.Reister. Basically, see [[TLT WIKI CSS]].

Well, I stole it years ago :) Nice design btw, spares us design-wise illiterates loads of trouble. I'm trying stuff out at: http://kravica.no-ip.org/cgi-bin/userwiki.pl/filip/Filip's_Home. You will recognize the stylesheet :) and note that sometimes it just might not work.

BTW, you should probably mention that one needs the <tt>sidebar.pl</tt> extension to get the sidebar displayed etc.

Good point good point on the sidebar.pl. I partially upgraded to the latest oddmuse recently, so I should probably make sure everything works sometime.

Also I'd like to point out firefox's EditCSS http://www.google.com/search?btnI=1&q=EditCSS

Oh. and I'm going to make a google: and lucky: wiki shortcut :)

Awwaiid -- Nice use of OddMuse.  It would be cool if the sidebar.pl extention could be used to have different sidebars on different pages.  I suppose it's on Alex's list, but it would also be nice to see either a better blogging module, or maybe some integration with something like WordPress.  The difference between Home and Frontpage is hard to guess; might be worth using other descriptors. -- Jeff

Thanks for the nice remarks, Jeff. Yeah, I think that the multiple-sidebar request is somewhere on Alex's list. Good point on the [[Home]] vs Frontpage... I've been thinking about that for a while, but haven't decided what to do.

One thing that someone set up, which I was thinking of customizing, is an email->wiki gateway, but more specifically an email->blog gateway. Someday.

Hi .. Very creative use of Oddmuse to build this website. I like it..
Say, would the graphiz/dot language module be available somehow?

-- [mailto:bobmc@futureway.com BobMc] 2005-02-19 18:38 UTC

Yeah, all my modules currently in use are at http://thelackthereof.org/wiki_data/modules and also see http://www.oddmuse.org for lots of other plugins. Graphviz/dot itself must be installed separately on your server though.

Hello, just wanted to let you know that in Safari when you put "clear:both" in the hr tag, the hr is moved to the bottom of the sidebar, as it's a float element... so all the content is moved as well. I'm also using sidebar.pl for my site and only use clear:left which is a pain when I want to float a picture to the right... 

UPDATE: looking around on the web, it seems that Safari is doing the right thing, the CSS specs say that a clear element must be placed under all the floated elements earlier in the code, even if from other blocks...

Just add that I've solved this issue in my site by changing the display of the browse, page and journal classes to "table". This works fine in Safari and in Firefox. Haven't tested it in IE... I don't know if I'm exploiting a bug or if this is actually the correct behaviour...

-- [http://george.makasoft.net/en George] 2005-02-25 12:16 UTC

Well I tried that and it seemed to have other subtle effects (on my site anyway). Maybe this weekend I can go at it in more depth.

Thanks for the tip! :)

Well... I've been all day with this on my site... css support in different browsers is hell :)

I managed to correct the width problems with that solution, but I get the feeling it's still exploiting a bug... 

I ended up with a css tables layout for the sidebar, which IE doesn't support... oh, well...

UPDATE: I give up :) I'd rather not use clear:both for the hr tag and have a site that's more compatible... now I use only clear:left which makes floating images to the right a pain...

hehe. I think I went through that a long time ago. Some of my friends use safari, and I told them that if my site annoys them enough to send me a patched CSS that still works in firefox/IE :). Lazy way out, I know. I thought that I'd go fix it myself someday but then never got around to it.

It's not Pretty enough. You could do much better awwaiid. The cool Boxs I made you perfect that one time with that one webpage. You know the ones that drop when you go over them but also the coloring you did. It made your website really cool and I told lots of stupid people that don't comprehend about it. They didn't understand how hard it was to make.

hah. It was hard to make at the time but now its like sooooo easy that everyone and their brother can do it so not me. no sirreee bobski. In this site I'm going for sort of a minimalist look with no flash and glitter stuff.

You want your own website? I can hook you up.

I'm actually suprised you bothered with myspace enough to put up a link to here... Here I thought you fell off the face of the earth.  I see I've been replaced by cats. - Schnebly
