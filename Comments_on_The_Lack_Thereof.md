Hi, I run a couple of Oddmuse wikis, one at home and the other in the intranet at the office. I like your site's layout anc CSS, do you make it available? I was just looking for an central area plus sidebar arrangement.

AFAICS, you can steal the style from the source of the generated HTML and put into your oddmuse...

Yeah, I had email contact with Jan.Reister. Basically, see [[TLT WIKI CSS]].

Well, I stole it years ago :) Nice design btw, spares us design-wise illiterates loads of trouble. I'm trying stuff out at: http://kravica.no-ip.org/cgi-bin/userwiki.pl/filip/Filip's_Home. You will recognize the stylesheet :) and note that sometimes it just might not work.

BTW, you should probably mention that one needs the <tt>sidebar.pl</tt> extension to get the sidebar displayed etc.

Good point good point on the sidebar.pl. I partially upgraded to the latest oddmuse recently, so I should probably make sure everything works sometime.

Also I'd like to point out firefox's EditCSS http://www.google.com/search?btnI=1&q=EditCSS

Oh. and I'm going to make a google: and lucky: wiki shortcut :)

Awwaiid -- Nice use of OddMuse.  It would be cool if the sidebar.pl extention could be used to have different sidebars on different pages.  I suppose it's on Alex's list, but it would also be nice to see either a better blogging module, or maybe some integration with something like WordPress.  The difference between Home and Frontpage is hard to guess; might be worth using other descriptors. -- Jeff

Thanks for the nice remarks, Jeff. Yeah, I think that the multiple-sidebar request is somewhere on Alex's list. Good point on the [[Home]] vs Frontpage... I've been thinking about that for a while, but haven't decided what to do.

One thing that someone set up, which I was thinking of customizing, is an email->wiki gateway, but more specifically an email->blog gateway. Someday.

Hi .. Very creative use of Oddmuse to build this website. I like it..
Say, would the graphiz/dot language module be available somehow?

Yeah, all my modules currently in use are at http://thelackthereof.org/wiki_data/modules and also see http://www.oddmuse.org for lots of other plugins. Graphviz/dot itself must be installed separately on your server though.

Hello, just wanted to let you know that in Safari when you put "clear:both" in the hr tag, the hr is moved to the bottom of the sidebar, as it's a float element... so all the content is moved as well. I'm also using sidebar.pl for my site and only use clear:left which is a pain when I want to float a picture to the right...
