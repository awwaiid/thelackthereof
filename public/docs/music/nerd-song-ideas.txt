== Don't Repeat Yourself ==

Don't repeat yourself
Don't repeat yourself
Yeah the blog post said
  / Said the little elf
  / Let me say again
  / Do it for your health
  / I've said it myself
  / Said the book on the shelf
Don't repeat yourself

But I asked myself
How can that be
When such a thing
Is hypocrasy

Cause' the other day
It said the tight coupling
Is the absolute
Most horrid thing

And if everything
Depends on everything
Then tight coupling
Is the only thing

Don't repeat yourself
Don't repeat yourself
Yeah the blog post said
Don't repeat yourself

[music interlude]

Spent all last week
Thinkin bout my code
All the duplicate lines
It has to load

I factored out
All the common bits
Then I sat back
To watch the hits

I got three downloads
Of my app today
Guess that extra week
Is the price I pay

Don't repeat yourself
Don't repeat yourself
Yeah the blog post said
Don't repeat yourself

Binary Tree Walk
To the tune of Jail House Rock


Step to the left,
Step to the right,
If both are null,
You're a leaf alright

Well let's walk
Let's walk
Depth first is a lock,
Doing the binary tree walk
