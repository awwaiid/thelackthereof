Lately I've been interested in digital audio. While exploring, I ran into the PortAudio library, which makes it really easy to output sound from a variety of languages and on a variety of platforms.

I decided that using generators and combinators would be a good way to play around with this ... and after a while I started wondering what it would look like in different languages...
