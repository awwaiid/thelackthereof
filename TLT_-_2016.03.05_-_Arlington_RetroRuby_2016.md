Today I attended [retroruby.org], a great un-conference in Arlington. I got my toehold in the local Ruby community at the Arlington meetup, and was happy to visit with lots of familiar people. I didn't meet any new people, though that was mostly because it was easy to spend time catching up.

Next time I want to jump in a bit stronger on the new-dev track, maybe walk through some hands-on exercises or do a group activity (Randori).

My favorite, besides talking to people, was the lightning talks. These have a bit more technical depth and include some code getting projected, which I love. I gave a quick this-thing-exists talk on [reactrb.org].

In the hallway track I also got to preach a bit about [[Module Level Polyglot]] :)
