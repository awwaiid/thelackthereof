From Mike Bennett's WayV page:

<blockquote>
wayV is...
1. Experiment with human computer interaction, especially gesture based computing.

<blockquote>
2. Initially some software that does hand writing/gesture recognition. Shapes represent actions and are input via the mouse, i.e. draw a B and the "b" key press is sent to your Xterm, draw a C and xcalc starts, draw an N and Netscape starts, etc.
