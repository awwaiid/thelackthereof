Tags: Perl, PPW, Conference

This weekend I attended [http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/ PPW2011] - I think this is my 3rd PPW, and my fourth perl conference in Pittsburgh (YAPC::NA 2009 was there).

The theme this year was "DevOps", and I think maybe that was not quite to my taste (though does seem practical). I like talks that push my understanding and stretch my mind, whereas the talks tended toward solid best practices for corporate environments. I gave a talk on debugging, and I even feel that my own talk went that way a bit :)

Favorite talks:
* [http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/talk/3502 Postmodern Module Packaging]
* [http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/talk/3803 Running an online game]
* [http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/talk/3878 Mo is Less] (lightning)
* [http://pghpw.org/ppw2011/talk/3861 A Dominus Chrestomathy]

That last one was a set of mini-talks by Mark-Jason Dominus, which included one of my all-time favorites, [http://perl.plover.com/yak/debruijn/ Debugging the de Bruijn Sequence]. Highly recommended!
