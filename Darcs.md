== David's Advanced Revision Control System ==
[http://abridgegame.org/darcs/ Darcs] is a neat CVS replacement with a cleaner philosophy backing its system of patches. I will probably be using Darcs from now on in my projects and perhaps some of my documents. If you find one of my project directories contains a subdir named '_darcs' then you know you can use darcs to join me in development.

For example, you can do 'darcs get http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/setdb' to get a copy of SetDB. After that you can use 'darcs pull http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/setdb' to get changes. There are ways for you to email me your patches, but I don't know them yet.
