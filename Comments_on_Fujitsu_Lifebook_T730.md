Hi!
I got myself a T730 too (a cheaper configuration, though) and found it works pretty well with Ubuntu 10.10 RC. However I cannot get pen input and the touch screen working at the same time. The pen works out-of-the-box but stops working as soon as I create a xorg.conf like yours. Touch works perfectly with a xorg.conf. I also tried removing the definitions for the pen but it's still not responding until I delete xorg.conf completely.
What which versions of the wacom drivers and X11 are you using in your working configuration? Do you have any other tips for me?

Thanks in advance,
Lukas
