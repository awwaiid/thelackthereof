* Get simplecov results from a single test or execution. Create a copy of the codebase where you delete all uncovered code and then reformat the remaining code -- a minimal codebase to do whatever your test needed.
* Annotate p6 roast and docs so you can have roast coverage metric for docs
* Create some examples of Inline::Python from p6 that use scipy
* Integrate Jupyter protocol into an LREP middleware
* Implement REPL.here for rakudo
