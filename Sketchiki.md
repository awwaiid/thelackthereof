== Goal ==
Ultimately the goal is to digitalize my long-time usage of a [http://www.moleskine.com/catalogue/classic/hard_black_cover/sketchbook__pocket.php Moleskine Pocket Sketchbook]. There are several things that can never be digitalized (battery life!), and several advantages that digitalization provides (backups!). I'll use the word "sketch" even though most of the time I'm actually taking notes... the point is that I'm doing handwriting not typing. Here is the gist of it:

* Quickly get to where I can start making a new sketch
** When someone is telling me what to buy them at subway, I don't have time to wait for a lot of loading and button pressing before I can even start writing.
* Quickly get to a recent sketch
* Use a stylus (or finger) to accurately sketch
** I should be able to sketch an actual picture, or write in a normal small font
* Flip through not-so-recent sketches
* Have enough room to generally avoid scrolling
** I never had to scroll with my Moleskine!

And some things that my Moleskine couldn't do:
* Undo/Redo
* Backups!
* Tag or name sketches
* Search sketches
** By tag, name, or date at least
** By sketching would be cool :)
*
