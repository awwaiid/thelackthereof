Arg. I turn my QuestionAsker extension off for less than two days and I get SPAMed! I'm turning it back on and fixing it so that people can add comments again. My previous idea was to allow comments without the question, but the recent spam was added to both my sidebar AND to the comment section on my sidebar. Evil.
