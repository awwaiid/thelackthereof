I recently got a [http://store.shopfujitsu.com/fpc/Ecommerce/buildseriesbean.do?series=T730 Fujitsu Lifebook T730], the package with these specs:

Plus I got the extra battery for the swappable bay.

== Ubuntu 10.04 on the Fujitsu Lifebook T730 ==

I thought I'd boot into windows to make sure all the hardware worked before replacing it with linux, but after it rebooted for the 4th time while doing it's configuration I gave up and killed it. I didn't even make it to the desktop. So unfortunately that means I can't do much of a comparison there.

I had an Ubuntu 10.04 disk, so I tried that first. Almost everything works out of the box! In fact, the only thing that doesn't work is the capacitive touch screen and screen buttons. I haven't tried the fingerprint reader, and probably won't mess with it at all. I also haven't tried the HDMI, though I'll probably give that a go eventually.

Highlights of what works:
* Pen input -- perfect, though needs some calibration
* Wireless -- perfect
* Touchpad -- perfect, scrollyness and all. It needs to be more sensitive though.
* Webcam -- perfect
* Sound -- perfect
* Screen -- perfect. Fully controllable via xrandr and some wacom tool.
