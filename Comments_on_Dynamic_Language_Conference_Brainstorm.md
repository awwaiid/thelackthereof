This sounds like a great idea. In particular I think it would interesting to look at features that are unique to a particular language (good or bad). This is the more exciting stuff that helps programmers grow. Seeing the differences of how Ruby, Python, or Perl declares arrays or concatenates strings or something similar seems mundane (in comparison). I probably know Python best so maybe I could give a talk about unique Python features? This could include context managers, doc strings, and maybe more. It might also be interesting to hear about less common programming techniques and how they could be useful (coroutines, currying, etc..). Anyhow, really great idea and I look to forward to going to the event and maybe even talking. Thanks,  

Erik
