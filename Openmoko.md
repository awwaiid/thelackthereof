I got my Openmoko on 2008-09-04!

I'll be keeping notes here for now.

== Distributions ==
I've tried several, here's a run-down.

=== Om 2007.02 ===
This is what the phone comes with. It is very minimal and works a little... but not much. But you can ssh into it! You might be able to make calls... but I blew it away before I got my sim card.

=== Om 2008.08 ===
This is the first one I installed. At first it didn't seem quite right.... but somehow it got better. Or perhaps I became more patient.

=== Qtopia ===
I dropped the latest qtopia on there. It looks nice, but not being able to run gtk apps killed it for me. Again, I haven't tested the phone call abilities because it was before I had the sim card. I went back to Om 2008.08.

=== Debian ===
So far this is my favorite. I used their fancy install script to nuke my 8gig microSD card and set everything up. It took something like 2 hours to run, and had no issues at all.

Once running, via ssh (since zhone-only is the default UI and there is no terminal to be found) I switched to xfce and have been having a wonderful time ever since. Zhone itself can run in a window in xfce. With this distro I have apt-get access to all of debian and a full linux desktop. Easier to start out full and complex and widdle back down to simplicity, I say!

== MicroSD Card ==
I got the SanDisk 8gb card, and so far it works perfectly.

== Sim Card ==
I walked in to a T-Mobile and bought a pre-paid card for testing. I can't use the internet on it, only voice, and so far it works perfectly. It is very flimsy looking though.

== Headphone Adapter ==
I got a 2.5mm -> 3.5mm adapter from radio shack that works perfectly. It is the radio shack brand (says 274-004 in the corner). I had to mess with alsa to get sound going through it. I didn't notice if it was stereo or mono yet, but definitely out of both speakers.
