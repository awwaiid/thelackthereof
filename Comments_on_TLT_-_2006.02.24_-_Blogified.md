Excellent timing! I finally started using an RSS reader. For now it's Safari. I tried Google Reader but there is no option to change the default which opens things in new windows. I suppose I could get a Firefox extension that just puts pop up windows in the same window, or even write some GreaseMonkey code to get it to work. But for now it's Safari. The only thing I really use Safari is for the RSS reader (I use Firefox for general web surfing).

I still think there's got to be a better way out there for keeping track of news.
