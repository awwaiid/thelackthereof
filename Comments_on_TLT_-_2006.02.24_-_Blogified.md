Excellent timing! I finally started using an RSS reader. For now it's Safari. I tried Google Reader but there is no option to change the default which opens things in new windows. I suppose I could get a Firefox extension that just puts pop up windows in the same window, or even write some GreaseMonkey code to get it to work. But for now it's Safari. The only thing I really use Safari is for the RSS reader (I use Firefox for general web surfing).

I still think there's got to be a better way out there for keeping track of news.

I know I'm a dork... I just can't help myself! Just wait till you come back to my page someday and see that I now have a gradient background in my header!

Ben, I haven't found much of a good rss reader either. Lately I've been using email2rss to keep track of changes on my wiki's (which all have RSS feeds)... but this is only effective because there aren't all that many changes.
