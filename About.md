This is the website and wiki of me, Brock Wilcox a.k.a. [[awwaiid]]. Please see the [[Home]] page if you would like a less philosophical introduction to this site. Otherwise, read on!

I love living in the future -- we have so many neat things. One of my favorites is the internet. For me the internet is a powerful communication tool, and this website is one of the ways I utilize the internet to communicate. By placing my thoughts, papers, and projects on this site for the world to view I hope to communicate a little about myself to whomever is interested in knowing me.

Full duplex communication (two-way) is very important. One reason I do not like television is its one-way-ness. Part of this certainly comes down to choice. Even with a thousand channels I still am limited to what they happen to be playing at the moment (for the most part). I can't imagine going to a library and being told that there are 1000 books to choose from and that I must read them right then and that they may not be there again if I were to return. Choice of what communications I receive is not the only issue with half-duplex channels, however. I also want to have a voice of my own, even if it is only one among many.

    Without a voice
        we cannot be heard
    Without being heard
        our will cannot be known
    Without our will being known
        we cannot attain well-being

    Find your voice!
    Sing out your will!
    One step on the path
