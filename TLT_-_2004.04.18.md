And who says perl error messages are not accurate?

  Time::HiRes::sleep(-0.185915): negative time not invented yet

So today I am still working on my math test (and a Buddha essay too, actually). It's kind of stressfull because I'm not quite halfway done yet and am additionally feeling kind of ill. But I trudge on!

Talked to the Principal Software Engineer over at [http://openratings.com/ Open Ratings] about their "Data Processing Algorithm Developer" position. I'm really excited about it because I'd get to do one of my favorite things -- develop algorithms and APIs the way that ''should'' be done. I might even fly out there for an interview soon.

Oh My God. I just now decided I should learn more about the latest fad, "Aspect Oriented Programming" (AOP). I started with

  http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2004/01/14/aop.html

which seems like a reasonable introduction. Let me give you a summary... AOP is a giant HACK (and not in a [[Right Thing]] sort of way). They invent some vocabulary which, so far as I can tell at this point, inserts hooks into pre-existing code. That way you can run some ''new'' code at the entrance or exit of a method... or insert a new initializer or destructor.

Again, from what I understand, it does this at the JVM level (for java, anyway) so that you can do this in pre-compiled code if you so desire.

The argument for AOP is that you can add orthogonol functionality to programs transparently. In the article above, for example, they mention being able to add a nice logging facility to existing code. The code itself shouldn't have to deal with logging as that is not its purpose, so they create these sort of hooks to add that functionality whithout cluttering code. Such functionality could also be added in a matter of minutes instead of the hours it might take to insert this code into the actual flow.

I would now like to take this time to say that <b>THIS IS THE STUPIDEST THING OF WHICH I HAVE EVER HEARD</b>! I cannot imagine that this could possibly lead to ''better'' programs... instead I imagine programs which become harder and harder to follow and understand and debug. Harder then spreadsheets even! This is simply a very very bad idea.

If there is anyone out there who can shed some light on why anyone might actually want to use this evil crap please let me know! I am very curious!
