I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love the [[Yucca Tap Room]].

We went over there last night... figure that it would be our last evening spent here while not packing for a while. Jason, Liz, Beth, and I. Played shuffleboard and drank cheap beer... live band after a bit. First this one guy played alone, good player but made some aweful comments and jokes. Then a full band got on and played some nice loud rock stuff.

Its the kind of bar I'd hang out in if I was an alchoholic or was always avoiding my wife.
