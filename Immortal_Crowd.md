== Lyrics ==
How our faces felt they
swelled from the blood
We draind our river and sank
like a wounded stud

As the time draws near
day turns to night
What good are these wings
can we not take flight?

And when the rapture comes
takes all our friends
At least you'll keep me company
as the rest ascend

Here we wait for our
fate with fear arounsed
Time means nothing to the
immortal crowd
