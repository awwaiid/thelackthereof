== Comments / Contact ==
For comments there is a link at the bottom of this page, but also feel free to email me questions and thoughts (mailto:awwaiid@thelackthereof.org). This is of course an ongoing project which needs quite a bit of refinement. Your questions, comments, and contributions will give me the feedback I need to make this system useable and clean. If enough people inquire about this project, I'll set up a mailing list.
