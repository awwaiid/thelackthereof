Reading <i>The Turing Test</i> (ISBN 0262692937), I have been filled with insights. The book is a collection of essays, including a few from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing Turing himself], concerning the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test Turing Test] and more generally criteria for intelligence as a whole. I highly recommend the book if you are interested in that sort of thing even in the slightest.

Insight of the moment: Lets say that we have a machine which can pass the Turing test. What makes us thing we could convince it to actually participate? I imagine a funny little skit in which the machine and its creator have a conversation, in which the machine refuses to play the game, feeling it beneath itself and hurt that it wasn't obvious already how intelligent it was.

Finally the machine creator puts the machine into the test against its wishes. The machine, being "funny", begins the conversation with "Hello. I am ELIZA. How can I help you?".
