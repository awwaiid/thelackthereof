Are you sure you didn't mean simplex?

Half-Duplex:
Data communications mode which permits transmission in both directions, but only in one direction at a time.

Simple:
Operating a channel in one direction only with no ability to operate in the other direction. For example one side of a telephone conversation is all that could be carried by a simplex line.
