I like to think of programming as language-building. You are using standard ways to extend the programming language you are working in, building up something that expresses the algorithms of your domain.

Recast MVC into the world of HTML/CSS. The HTML is supposed to describe how things fit together logically, the CSS makes it pretty. In a database frontend app, you could just let people edit the DB directly, perhaps with some updateable views. But we want it pretty, so we wrap layout forms around it.

arg. so many thoughts in my brain, so little time to record them let alone implement them!
