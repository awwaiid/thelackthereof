I upgraded from my trusty [[Fujitsu Lifebook T730]] in early 2013.

Base specs:
* 13.3" (1920x1080)
* Intel i7-3517U (1.9Ghz)
* 4GB DDR3 (2 onboard, 2 modular)
* Intel HD4000 onboard
* Nvidia 620M 1GB bonus video
* 500GB (W/ 24GB flash cache)
* 3 x USB 3.0 ports
* Micro-VGA port, dongle converts to full VGA
* HDMI port

Upgrades:
* 8gb stick, plus the 2gb onboard, for 10gb RAM total
* 250gb Samsung SSD to replace the 500gb spinning disk

Install:
* Debian Sid
* gnome-session base with xmonad window manager

Fun stuff:
* Just about everything works out of the box
* At first it didn't work, but after a kernel upgrade I can use the HDMI and the VGA and the built in screen all at the same time. Triple screens!
* bumblebee provides 'optirun', which lets me run an individual program with the accellerated nvidia card. Fancy!
