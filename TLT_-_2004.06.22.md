Well openratings reimbursed me for my plane flight and car rental, which was nice of them (though a bit short of the $1200 rent I wouldn't mind them covering). I have leads with VMWare, LLNL, and ''maybe'' Novell... in addition to a bunch of other applications. So things on that front are going pretty well.

I need to pop over and see Rena (and Mario! and Carlos!) but I keep getting distracted. She is probably pretty busy anyway though.
