Welcome to http://thelackthereof.org/. This is the website of Brock Wilcox - It's dual purpose is to inform others as to my existence and activities, and also to help me organize my [[Web-of-Beliefs]]. If you want more of a third-party view of me, you could also do a [http://www.google.com/search?q=awwaiid Google Search for awwaiid]. Please leave your [http://thelackthereof.org/wiki.pl/Comments_on_The_Lack_Thereof Comments on The Lack Thereof], so that I can make this site useful. Well... actually it is useful to me and that's what matters most. But I'll take feedback anyway :)

The major sections are at the top and side navigation bars, and described below. Other things can be found through the search feature at the bottom of every page, and by browsing around. If you want to add content, please see the [[Text Formatting Rules]] and practice in the [[SandBox]]. This website is run by [http://www.oddmuse.org/ OddMuse].

<h3>[[Projects]] - Eat. Sleep. Code.</h3>
These are project which I am or have worked on (or perhaps just thought about). I welcome contributions of any form, including philosophical discussion and code. My general habit is to begin lots of projects and never finish them, and I hope that this page will properly reflect this tendency.

<h3>[[Docs]] - The Pen is Mightier... </h3>
Here you will find both text-based projects (in which case [[Docs]] should technically be a subsection of [[Projects]]) and some formal pieces of writing. Oh, and I also have a library of things I've collected from the internet.

<h3>[[Links]] - There and Back Again.</h3>
I have a page of links to other places for two reasons. The first is for myself so that I have some idea of the pages I like. The second is for you... through knowing the things that I like or at least link to you can probably infer quite a bit of information about things I'd like to be linked to me :)

<h3>[[TLT]] - The Lack Thereof.</h3>
Originally ''The Lack Thereof'' was just the name of my online journal. I've continued to keep the log on and off for the last few years, most recently right here on this website. You can find the 10 most recent entries on the [[TLT]] page. The calendar in the sidebar also links to entries for this month.
