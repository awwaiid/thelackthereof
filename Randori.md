Randori == "Pair Programming Musical Chairs"

* Roles:
** <b>Driver</b> -- One person at the keyboard. Don't think, just type (maybe syntax-level -- write a function, extract a method, if they know the language). Only does what the Navigator tells them to do.
** <b>Navigator</b> -- Sit next to the driver and direct them. Can also ask the choir/queue for advice, especially if they aren't familiar with the technology being used
** <b>Choir</b> -- Everyone else, watching and kibitzing as appropriate and helpful to the Navigator
** <b>Bonus role: Guide</b> -- this person knows the tech and guides the current Navigator, teaching the whole group through the guidance
* Group picks a problem with specific goals / strategy (or one is provided by moderator)
* After a fixed amount of time (3-5mins) or event (red/green/refactor) everyone ROTATES! Driver re-joins the choir, Navigator becomes the Driver, a member of the choir becomes the Navigator
* Do this for a while (1-2 hours maybe, or a nice stopping point) and then everyone reviews

This works well with toy problems and small challenges. I've done it with command-line games especially, but other things also like going through a tutorial or one time we built a Christmas Tree out of pure CSS and a few divs
