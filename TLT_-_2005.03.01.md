I wonder what the world would be like without the '@' symbol. I remember back when I had my first computer, an Apple ][e, which was when I first noticed the symbol. I hated it. I mean... who needs an abreviation for 'at'? Its only two letters long as it is! I refused to use it, even when typing short-hand notes.

But look at me now... I use '@' all the time. The first thing that comes to mind is email addresses. What would we use instead of '@'? Well they used random stuff before Ray started the '@' thing in '67, and would surely have gotten along just fine. So I cruise on over to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_at wikipedia], and lowe-and-behold... italians. Yep... the '''ampersat''' very likely came out of the renaissance.

If they only knew how much they were contributing to Perl!
