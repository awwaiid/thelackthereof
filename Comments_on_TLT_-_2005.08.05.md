So, where ARE you guys? If I remember correctly, when we ran into you and Beth at Daily Bread before we left, it sounded like Beth was going to take master's classes at ASU... so are you back down in the Valley again, or what? I love reading your journal entries, now that I've found you, and while I don't have a CLUE what you're talking about computer-wise, I enjoy reading about what you're both up to...


Life...
turning...
turning back...
re-turning.
