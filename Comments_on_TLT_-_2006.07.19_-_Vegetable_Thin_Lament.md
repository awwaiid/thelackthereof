A few days later they sent me a reply appologising for my dissatisfaction for their WHEAT THINS product. I cried.

Then, a few weeks later, in the mail came a coupon for some free WHEAT THINS. Makes me want to write another letter... I SAID VEGETABLE THINS, PEOPLE!!

Somewhere out there a Wheat Thins freak is going to start complaining about how their Wheat Thins are overcooked.
