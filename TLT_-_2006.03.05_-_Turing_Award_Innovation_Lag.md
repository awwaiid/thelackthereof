A few days ago I noticed that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur Peter Nuar] was given the 2005 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_award Turing Award]. I thought to myself "self, doesn't that name sound familiar?" "I believeit does," I replied. That is Peter Naur of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus-Naur_form Backus-Naur Form]. That, in conjunction with his greater work on Agol 60, is why re got the award. Backus got his award in 1977, for inventing FORTRAN (which is, shall we say, significant).

But why the lag between the work and the award? Its not like we just now noticed that BNF and Algol have had a huge contribution to software technology. Looking at the list I saw some others... Alan Kay wasn't recognised until 2003 for his early 1970's work; the RSA guys were recognised in 2002 for work from 1977.

Maybe its not a big deal -- it could be that it just takes a while to recognise the work. The early awards were given for more recent works because there <i>weren't</i> older works. Maybe the Turing Award itself is lagging in quality or direction.

But what if our rate of innovation has slowed?
