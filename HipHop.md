There is some subset of Hip Hop music that I like -- I don't know the name of it. I've been doing random sampling for a while ... now it's time to take some notes.

* Atmosphere
** Yesterday - nice beat, nice twist in the story
* Hilltop Hoods
** Hard Road, Restrung -- cool album with symphonic backing
