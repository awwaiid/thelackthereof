Last night at the Perl meetup we collaboratively built a proof-of-concept for storing key/value pairs as messages in a slack channel, [https://github.com/plicease/globalhash]. Example usage:

<code>
$ globalhash set hello world # writes "hello=world" into the #globalhash channel
$ globalhash get hello       # reads the #globalhash channel for the most
                             # recent value of hello and prints it
world
</code>

There are of course a TON of things you could do from here. Some ideas:
* More features: list of keys, delete, complex values, binary values, value history
* Clean implementation and better usage/error messaging, docs
* Port to other languages -- perl6 and still using the perl5 module would be fun
* Register as a slack app that anyone can use, fix up OAuth or whatever
