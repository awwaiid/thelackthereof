Welcome to October! I really should fix my SimpleChanges thingie... I didn't realize how much I used that until it was gone. But I'm too busy working right now. Working to use http://egroupware.org which is going OK. I even get flashes sometimes where I consider using it for eggplant farms. But then it passes.

I was just checking out http://www.kjack.org/ and noticed some subtle but quite good changes that David made. I like it. Snow mentioned to him that he'd like a re-design, something... using Frontpage. ick. What a horrible idea that is. You should have seen it before I started... nnaaaasssttyyyy. The problem is that Snow doesn't see it getting utilized, so he believes that a redesign will somehow fix it. Truth be told, however, the trick is in advertising, not in its look. The site is clean and works well, and people use the shout-box quite a bit actually. But they have no motivation to use any other part of the site. Soon DJ's will start putting up their own pages, which will help.

Anyway. bah. Back to work I think.
