I miss you guys. Semester hell is finally over and all is well. How's Beth doing? And are you guys coming down to the valley or are you working there via Flagstaff?

Leslie Gurney came into the store a couple of weeks ago. She's a D&D Dork now, which cracked me up. It was great to see her again, though, since I hadn't since before your wedding.

Happy Anniversaryishness, by the way. (I know I'll forget over the next few days. :p)
