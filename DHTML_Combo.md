This is exactly what it sounds like. I looked around for a solution,  but got tired of that quite quickly so just wrote my own. I use a plain textbox and a hidden listbox (SELECT box). When the textbox gets focus the list is displayed right under it, just like a real combo box.

Get the code: darcs get http://thelackthereof.org/projects/javascript/dhtml_combo
