I do! I do!

Vim is an improved clone of vi (see [http://www.vim.org/ vim.org]) which is free under the GPL. It used to be guilt-ware (you could use it if you felt guilty about not donating to the author's cause), but now it is Free.

I won't go into a holy-war rant on this one because, well, I just like vim better and don't really care about emacs or others. I don't hate them. I don't want to recruit people. I just love vim.
