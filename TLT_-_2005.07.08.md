You know how if you say a word over and over and over again sometimes it starts to sound very strange to the ears... altering the word into some sort of alien sound? Lately I've had a similar issue with my mouse pointer.

When you place your pointer over a link, instead of an arrow or a text-cursor (the I-shaped thingie), you get a funny little hand pointing at the link. I noticed this hand icon when I first saw it, and thought it was ugly and stupid. Then, over the course of years of having it there, doing its thing, I forgot all about my weird feelings toward the pointy hand.

Since I've been doing so much we stuff recently I once again noticed the pointer. I've also been switching back and forth between Mac, Windows, and X, which has probably made it more apparent. All of a sudden I feel transported back in time to when this whole "pointer" idea was crazyness... and having <i>more than one pointer</i> was just revolutionary. Cursors used to turn all sorts of shapes, really, much less subtle than now. My favorite is/was the bomb from xkill. Even so, I bet lots of people have the same reaction as I initially had and am now having daily.

Whats with the pointy little hand?
