Been quite busy with work. In a good way though. Tonight did some crazy DB field resizing under pretty serious time-constraint... went acceptably I'd say.

Beth said something at dinner which has gotten me to think a bit about GP and the current status of [[OGPF]]. I left off at the spot where I was implementing some of Koza's examples. I didn't get very far because it really isn't very interesting to implement someone else's ideas... but I really do think that is the next step that I should do. After that I can move to the work Tinu Yu did on lambda-calculus as a genotype. And then, FINALLY, I can work on my own ideas about typed l-calc with various genotype-phenotype mappings.

Other than gereral results from evolving typed l-calc stuff, I think that one of the most promising directions that GP can take is optimizing pre-existing programs. Actually I'd like to clarify -- by "optimize" I mean either simplify algorithms or improve performance, but I expect that the GP will have to focus on one type of optimization or the other. Though of course the solution spaces for either overlap quite a bit, I'd guess. We'll see!

So I think I'll program until Beth is ready for bed.
