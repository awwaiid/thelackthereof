What did you make that diagram in?

PS:  It would be nice if the Comments_on_State_Scope page linked back to the State_Scope page.

The diagram was made using graphviz, I wrote a plugin to generate it directly from wiki pages here. So go back and edit-this-page to see the source.

At the very bottom of the page the "Comments on State Scope" link turns into the "State Scope" link when viewing comments. But you're right that it should be up at the top more.
