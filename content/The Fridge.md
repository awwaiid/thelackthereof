Ideas:
* Multiple fridges. Anyone can create a fridge, and it gets a password
* Fridges expire after n days of disuse
* Fridges get options
** Public/Private fridges (by view-password)
** Limit to the number of words. When you get >n words, the first word would dissapear

So the front page would be a list of fridges

Modes:
* View fridge list
* Create fridge -- fridge name, owner password
* Fridge preferences -- private password, word-limit
* Fridge itself -- manipulate the fridge!
