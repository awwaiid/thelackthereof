Last night at the [https://www.meetup.com/DC-Perl-Mongers/|DC Perl Mongers meetup] we collaboratively built a proof-of-concept for storing key/value pairs as messages in a slack channel, https://github.com/plicease/globalhash. This was made straightforward by great Slack API docs and cpan:WebService::Slack::WebApi. Example usage:

```
# writes "hello=world" into the #globalhash channel
$ globalhash set hello world

# reads the #globalhash channel for the most
# recent value of hello and prints it
$ globalhash get hello
world
```

There are of course a TON of things you could do from here. Some ideas:
* More features: list of keys, delete, complex values, binary values, value history
* Clean implementation and better usage/error messaging, docs
* Port to other languages -- perl6 and still using the perl5 module would be fun
* Register as a slack app that anyone can use, fix up OAuth or whatever
