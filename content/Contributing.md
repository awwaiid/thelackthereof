I welcome contributions to the projects on this site. That's part of why I make them all opensource -- share and share alike :) . I want to make it easy to do so -- here are some ways:

* Most of my projects are stored in darcs
** darcs get http://thelackthereof.org/project/projectname
** Hack hack hack
** darcs rec
** darcs send / darcs diff / diff + email / ask me to pull

I've also been mirroring stuff via github lately. I'll happily accept pull requests, patches, text descriptions of a change, or whatever you've got :)
