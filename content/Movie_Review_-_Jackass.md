Less of a film and more of a series of pranks and idiotic dares. It is difficult for me to believe that this series did so well that it became a film, and that the film actually made it to the theater. Makes me wonder about my fellow americans. I am ashamed of this film on the behalf of the entire film industry, of which I am not even a part.

Do not watch this movie.
