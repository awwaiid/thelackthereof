I think it would be nice to write an autobiography. Actually I think it would be neat to write 5 autobiographies, one every 20 years. I've missed the 20-year mark already, so I figure I can start on the first one now. I also want to get started on such a project sooner than later since I will surely forget things, more than I have already forgotten that is.

I'm also happy for this to be a semi-autobiography, so if there is anyone out there who has some good contributions... add them here! I'd be happy to do the same for you. Whoever you are.

So here is the plan: First I will record a timeline of events, a pretty factual account. Then (randomly) I will elaborate on some of these.
