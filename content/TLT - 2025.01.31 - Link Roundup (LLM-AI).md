My friend Brad asked about what I've been reading lately in the AI/LLM space to keep up. Here's my link roundup! Things that have been on my rotation lately.

* **[AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098166302)**: Great January-2025 catch up on consuming LLM/AI usage in real world applications; enough background to Get It without being distracted by details
* **[Simon Willison Website](https://simonwillison.net/)**: Follow for great links and chasing the dragon of new releases and thoughts
* **[LLM CLI (Datasette)](https://llm.datasette.io/)**: From Simon Willison, a very handy CLI tool for interfacing with LLMs. Once set up, I use this as a unixy native tool. Like ... `cat some_file.txt | llm -s 'Turn this into a CSV of street, city, state, zip' > data.csv`
* **[/r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/)**: Reddit community all about running local LLMs; even if you only ever run things on other people's computer (API) it is interesting to know what might be happening on the other side
* **[/r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/)**: Latest and Greatest with Claude Stuff
* **[Groq](https://groq.com/)**: Hardware accelerated LLM (also see [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai/))
* **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)**: Open source CLI coding assistant. They've been building up an [Aider LLM Leaderboard](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/) which is interesting, especially the highlighted polyglot board (one model for architecture plan, another for low-level coding)
* **[Sourcegraph Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody)**: There are several VSCode-embedded code assistants in this space, Cody is one to keep an eye on. Recently [Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits) has stepped up to a similar cross-file assistant too. There are a bunch of others; I'm not really psyched about switching from vim to vscode, and I _certainly_ don't want to switch to a proprietary editor, so I haven't spent much time with things like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (yet)
* **[Matthew Berman (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@matthew_berman/videos)**: He does videos with some demos and commentary that is pretty fun; I may not always agree, but even knowing what the latest _topics_ are is very helpful!
* **[Practical AI Podcast](https://changelog.com/practicalai)**: I listen to podcasts when I commute or go for longer drives, which isn't often but often enough that I've listened to some good episodes both here and on other ChangeLogs.
* **[Latent Space: The AI Engineer Podcast](https://www.latent.space/podcast)**: I've only listened to a few of these, but it is on top of my feed list in [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/) currently

... I think that'll do for now!
