Should be working on Buddha essay.

Had a great weekend at the AMUC. Ended up presenting on Sunday instead of Saturday, which was good (when another guy needed to trade times so he could leave early and I volunteered the organizer even said "must be good karma."

hmm... brb.

OK, got a draft going which Beth is proofing for me (thanks Beth!). She and I have quite different essay-writing styles, mine being quite informal while hers are very well structured, and Dr. Sullivan likes her style a lot more than he likes my style.

I'm feeling anxious about getting a job -- IBM turned me down.

Back on AMUC. I got to introduce the keynote speaker on Saturday, and that went well.
