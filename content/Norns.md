Monome Norns is a music-sentric device built on top of the Raspberri Pi by https://monome.org/. There is a healthy community at https://llllllll.co/ ("Lines"), though they talk about a lot more than only Monome. Norns is scripted primarily with Lua and SuperCollider, though is a fully Linux system.
