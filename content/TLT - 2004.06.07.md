Just had a lovely time on http://perlmonks.org/ reliving redneck moments while listening to [http://www.somafm.com/bootliquor/ BootLiquor] (House Of Mercy Band - Sunny Georgia).

Today I went with Judy to the harvard area. We ate and wandered and hung out and talked. Before that she came over here and saw our new place, which she liked. Very good day. Road the train/T and wandered around local Waltham a bit more. Still haven't gone to the library (will do that tomorrow).

Oh, and while on perlmonks saw the greatest haiku:

 Warm and humid night
 Hole in the screen; my cat and
 I - both chasing bugs.

It's just beautiful.
