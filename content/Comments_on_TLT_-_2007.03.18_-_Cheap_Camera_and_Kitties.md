Sweet!  That's the same camera I had ($10 little grey thing that takes 1 AAA battery).  I had a lto of fun with it before I lost it.  It'll take short movies, and I've posted a number of mine on http://slowass.net/~scott/ and in the photos directory, which I can't remember where I left as everything here is sorta in limbo.  

Congrats, and yes, more photos!  Oh, and I think it has 16megabits of RAM, or 2 megabytes.  Those EE types are trixie.  They used to do that video game carts.
