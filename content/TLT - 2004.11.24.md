Time for my weekly log entry :)

Adam is staying with us for the last day or so. Tonight we will go down to Tempe for Thanksgiving. Beth and I will hang out, no specific plans yet. The real fun is Fri-Sun, we will be going to Exotic Yuma! (if I haven't mentioned that before).To take Hammie to a dog show. Beth's mom is in MA visiting Rob&Patty.
