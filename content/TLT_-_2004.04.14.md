Before I forget... the coolest thing I've learned in my math history class is that

$$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \ln(\sqrt{3} + 2) \cdot i\right) = 2$$.

Please see for yourself on your TI-89 (and I'm sure others... I tried the 83+ and it couldn't hang with the complex input to sin).

I'm working on a take-home mathtest. [http://thelackthereof.org/docs/math/mat412/mat412:%20Test%20II%20notes.pdf Notes] and [http://thelackthereof.org/docs/math/mat412/mat412:%20Test%20II.pdf the test]. Fun stuff, eh?
