Delphi is a lovely programming language and environment. The programming language is more technically "Object Pascal" I believe. I learned Pascal in HS from Denton which was lovely... and Delphi just brings sweet memories. Good type system (no OCaml, but quite nice), acceptable editor... its just great.
