Happy Valentine's Day!

I'm very excited because I got a big chunk of [[SetDB]] to work. Though the code on the inside isn't the prettiest or most simple thing ever, the interface is shaping up quite nicely. There are still some things to work out of course, but so far so good. At this point I might show it to some people, but just a bit more and I might post it on http://www.perlmonks.org/ so that they can put in their thoughts.

Earlier this week I started an [[Autobiography]]. I think it could be fun, and goes along with the idea of this site being a map to a better understanding of myself.
