So you livejournal feed readers may have noticed that I finally fixed my feed. Now it sucks not just the subject but also the content including links. Since I now know that people might be listening I'll have to think of something useful to talk about... yeah right.

So now we will experiment to see what happens if I change an entry after it has been sucked over to livejournal. Wish me luck.

OK... this is a test of an updated entry!
