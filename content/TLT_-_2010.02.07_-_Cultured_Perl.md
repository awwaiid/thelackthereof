You might have stumbled upon some IBM developerWorks articles titled "Cultured Perl" while googling for random things. I think it's awesome and that it isn't linked to enough. Just a few weeks ago the latest article came out, [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cpan-net-amazon-s3/ Cultured Perl: Storage management on Amazon S3], which is well written and up-to-date with the latest technologies.

Thank you, Cultured Perl!
