Quoting with permission, March 20, 2004:

<Sunir> He saw Meatball as document-centric, and I see it as community-centric.

<Sunir> But I'm apparently post-modern and therefore unintelligible.

<awwaiid> are those really opposing views?

<Sunir> no

<Sunir> A community-centric viewpoint covers a document-centric one

<awwaiid> a community made up of documents

<Sunir> But you have to really understand what it means for things to be socially constructed to know why this theory is more powerful and more applicable.

<Sunir> no, the community *writes* the documents

<awwaiid> I understand social construction

<Sunir> The documents don't just appear.

<Sunir> So who ultimately is reading and writing the documents? the community. Therefore, the community is more important than their output.

<Sunir> At least to the survival of both the community and the corpus of the documents.

<awwaiid> but can the community be identified without the side-effect of the documents?

<Sunir> The documents don't grow by themselves, in other words, so they cannot be given priority to the community who maintains, upgrades, protects, defends, organizes, and otherwises *does* stuff to the documents

<Sunir> that's the interesting thing about community online 

<Sunir> everything goes through text.

<awwaiid> ya

<Sunir> I call it "LifeInText"

<Sunir> and that gives the community online properties missing in normal community 

<awwaiid> and takes some away, I'd say

<Sunir> LifeInText is the same collapse as software (machine and data)

<Sunir> yes

<Sunir> and software is less than machine and material; shucker and conr.

<Sunir> corn

<Sunir> in some ways, i mean

<awwaiid> shucker and corn?

<Sunir> just a type of machine

<awwaiid> oh. I know what you mean now.

<Sunir> but post-modernism also includes modernism

<Sunir> so my community-centric view will also include a document-centric view 

<awwaiid> (though i might say software is more than machine + data)

<Sunir> and also a style-centric

<Sunir> chat-centric

<awwaiid> ya

<Sunir> software is interesting in that while all information is both bits + encoding, software makes the encoding also bits

<awwaiid> though your analogy seems to be becomming inappropriate when comparing post-modern=community, modern=document-centric, etc

<Sunir> software then incorporates time

<Sunir> post-modernism is highly community-oriented.

<awwaiid> certainly I see that

<Sunir> that's because it prioritizes social forces rather than external objective realities.

<awwaiid> I'm just saying the analogy seems a bit fishy, and not necessary for your viewpoint

<awwaiid> yes, I see what you are getting at

<Sunir> well, the document-centric viewpoint presupposes a Truth, or at least a measure of truth.

<awwaiid> how so?

<Sunir> Well, it figures what is written down is fact; or valuable as a truth

<awwaiid> I don't see why a document-centric view couldnt' itself be twisted into a postmodern stance

<awwaiid> but in a wiki things change

<Sunir> whereas I would claim that nothing on the wiki is intelligible without the community to decode it.

<Sunir> which is another reason why copylefting a living wiki is dumb; no one else can read it.

<awwaiid> okay

<Sunir> also, modernism looks as the people as a group of individuals.

<awwaiid> what restriction that copylefting imposes would stop others from reading it?

<Sunir> so the individuals come to the wiki to read the documents to learn something, and then they go away (think "software manual").

<Sunir> individuals also come and may add things to the wiki because all individuals will be motivated to do so (i have no idea why people think this)

* Sunir will get to your question in a sec

<awwaiid> k

<Sunir> but a community-centric viewpoint sees the corpus as primarily a conversation and dialectic between people who care about one another with a common sense of identity; a MeatBall:CommonContext and a MeatBall:SuperordinateGoal

<wiki> -> http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SuperordinateGoal

<Sunir> MeatBall:CommonContext

<wiki> -> http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CommonContext

<Sunir> Which is why we have the MeatBall:BarnRaising motto

<wiki> -> http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?BarnRaising

<Sunir> the text on the wiki is primarily useful for aiding discussion within the community

<Sunir> it's a vocabulary for them

<Sunir> and since a wiki is so perfect for this (page names are concepts), it works out well for us

<awwaiid> ya

<Sunir> social construction of meaning

<Sunir> which is why you need the community to decode the text; it's not very clear to outside observers.

<Sunir> trust me, most pepole don't understand what we write 

<Sunir> ok, onto your question

<Sunir> Coyplefting doesn't stop people from accessing the text.

<awwaiid> I see. So by the time they understand the wiki they are basically part of the community, sharing the common language

<Sunir> it's just that they can't understand what we write without the MeatBall:CommunityLore that helps decode what we're talking about

<wiki> -> http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CommunityLore

<Sunir> right, except by reading a copy, they lose the ability to communicate with the community.

<Sunir> the text and the community are one

<Sunir> LifeInText

<Sunir> so, this is all disturbingly post-modern, I guess. it just makes sense to me as the plum obvious truth of it all.

<Sunir> but i'm secretly modernist. ;)

<awwaiid> ha

<Sunir> "plum obvious truth"

<awwaiid> *chuckle*

<awwaiid> Well I appreciate you sharing your perspective with me.

<Sunir> i hope it was enlightening
