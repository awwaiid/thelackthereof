Lunch table with Humans!

* **General Status:**
  * Morning
    * I find updating the `week` indicator on this checkin is already upsetting
    * I'm heading into The Hub today!
    * Going to see if I can do some IRL pairing
    * I need to work on some Human Essentials today, Wednesday is a stakeholder meeting
  * Evening
    * I had a delightful time sitting at the lunch table and chat chat chatting with peeps
    * HCI session was very interesting, with lots of discussion on Agency (which of course I'm very into)
    * Failed to do any IRL pairing, will try harder tomorrow!
* **Nerd Snipe:**
  * Played with [sov](https://github.com/milgra/sov) a bit, might use it to visualize virtual desktops. But maybe not
* **Alloy+LLM+Rails Project:**
  * I might want to actually really look at LangChain
  * I have all the tools for a tree-of-tokens working (albeit slowly), so now working on traversing that to turn it into some visualizations
