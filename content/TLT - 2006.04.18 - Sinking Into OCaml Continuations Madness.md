A while back it was announced on the OCaml mailing list that someone had created a [http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/Continuations.html#caml-shift userland delimited continuations] library for [[OCaml]]. I love OCaml, and I love Continuations... so I thought I'd give it a try. Ultimately going for the HTTP re-inversion trick, of course.

Little did I know what sort of a rabbit hole I was going down with Delimited Continuations. On the surface it doesn't seem that that big of a deal -- they're a lot like "normal" continuations (using call/cc or whatnot), except better. Instead of secretly being a function invocation that never returns, they are secretly a continuation that does.

At least thats what I've told myself. Unfortunately my brain doesn't like the explanations I've come accross so far. It makes perfect sense when I stand back a bit, but once I start trying to pound this keyboard to produce some code nothing seems to make sense. The best introduction I found so far is a [http://community.schemewiki.org/?composable-continuations-tutorial composable continuations tutorial] on the [http://community.schemewiki.org/ Community Scheme Wiki]. Some heavier readings (such as [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR615 A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations], on which the OCaml library is based) are a bit too fast-paced. Individual sentences are fine... but taken as a whole I'm not getting it.

Part of the problem is that when building [http://continuity.tlt42.org/ Continuity] (or its predecessor, [[Contize]]), I have actually been using coroutines rather than continuations, which simplify the situation a bit. So I haven't had to <i>really</i> deal with scheme's call/cc, let alone the various delimited versions such as shift/reset.

If it seems to you that I'm talking jibberish, perhaps you feel my pain.

I am making a bit of progress though. With the above tutorial and a few other searches the concepts are slowly starting to sink in. Eventually I will be able to explain it all through lovely diagrams of call-stack manipulations. Basically thats all these texts are missing -- nice simple diagrams.
