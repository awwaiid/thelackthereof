But I looovveeee TLT. Just get a more "professional" domain, go gmail, or something for those purposes.

Sniffle. I'll cry for TLT and you change domains too damn often! :)

Ohmygod someone left a comment! Of course it was mandie, who has done so before. eh.

I won't change domains, thelackthereof.org will still be the domain and tlt42.org will be a re-direct and short mail address, just like sf.net. I'm looking for an alias for thelackthereof.org, not a replacement.

Hmmm....I think I like "tlt42.org".  At least it sounds cool.
