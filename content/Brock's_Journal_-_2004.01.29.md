I am playing with the evil Epiphany webbrowser since my wonderful galeon is borked since I accidentally upgraded mozilla. Ick. Anyway, the interesting thing is I actually figured out how to work the bookmark toolbar thingie and added TheLackThereof as a textbox entry so I could just type in a topic name and it would jump to that topic. Maybe I should make it search for that topic... hmm.

In any case I tested it by typing in ''this'' topic. Thus here I am.

I've watched some movies lately, and have just been too lazy to do my little movie review thing that I did before. I do enjoy doing it though, so maybe I'll catch up.

This has been the first week for [http://aaron.ganschow.us/ Aaron] at work. It's quite nice and even exciting to have someone else to do my job with me. He is busily re-learning [[Visual Basic]] so that he can fix up Jill's database. Fun stuff.

Okay. Time to go.
