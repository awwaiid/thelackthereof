info about icfp2006

The Cult's scholarly publications are of particular interest to us. Because the Cult's journals were circulated on sandstone tablets, editors imposed very strict length limitations. Consequently, authors aggressively compressed their articles. A typical publication would have the following form:
PUZZL.TSK=100@1001|14370747643c6d2db0a40ecb4b0bb65

Should you encounter any such publications, we humbly request that you submit them to us via our web site. Our server will track all submitted publications, ensuring that every participant is given appropriate credit for advancing our understanding of the codex. Publications are of varying value; some will represent a greater contribution than others, and we will take this into account when assigning credit.
