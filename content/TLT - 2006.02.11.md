Hanging out in San Francico with [http://zigamorph.net/ Adam]. Specifically I'm here attending [http://codecon.org/2006/ CodeCon], which has been very enjoyable. It hasn't quite gotten me to suddenly produce tons of amazing code, but it has definitely been generally inspiring. And there's one more day!
