I added a new module for the wiki which tells how many comments have been made on a page. It works by adding text to the actual comments_on_ page and then parsing this. I should, perhaps, be using the actual storage of a page or something for speed... but this seems fast enough to me.

I should make sure it works for journal listings...

It does! Woo Hoo!
