<blockquote><i>Abstract: I present here a model of Free Will which aims to be of practical use both within one's own life and for understanding and having compassion for other entities. The model is built on defining Free Will as accurate prediction combined with accurate control. Because we can predict and control with varying accuracy about a topic, Free Will becomes a sort of probability field which can be strong or weak for an entity and dimension of will. Finally, I advocate for us each to seek ways of increasing our own Free Will.</i></blockquote>

In [[Predicting the Future]], I put forth the idea that predicting the future is the embodiment of Free Will. I think that can be refined.

There are various ways that people attempt to measure intelligence, IQ being the most famous, though of course having many advocates and enemies. Another framework for intelligence is the "multiple intelligences", which breaks the notion down into a set of categories, each with some independent (perhaps non-numerical) measure. Either way, they both backet out one's abilities and limits into various categories.

I wish to instead take a step back toward a more general definition of intelligence, one which overlaps with some of the categories presented in other measures of intelligence. Namely, I propose that "intelligence" is equivalent to "ability to accurately predict the future".

A lot of things can be used to predict the future, and there are a lot of different types of predictions that you can make. So you might be able to predict where a thrown ball will land based on some very quick parabolic curve heuristics. Or you might predict what emotion a written story will have on a reader. And there are several degrees of accuracy in predictions. The most obvious is how far into the future you can predict. Another is how fine-grained is the prediction itself - there is a big difference between predicting that tomorrow it will be hotter than today, and predicting that it will be 5.21 degrees hotter.

The tools that we use to predict the future are talked about a lot in intelligence tests. Typically, IQ will be broken down into short/long term memory, quantitative reasoning, spacial reasoning, and so on. Ultimately it is the prediction itself that matters though.

Next we contemplate the concept of control. Being able to control something is often called "will". Now of course all will comes down to controlling yourself - whether it be pronouncing a death sentence or grasping and turning a doorknob. But we can abstract that away a bit, and just think in terms of giving orders or opening doors. Either way, we are attempting to control something.

Often we fail to exert control. The order is counter-manded, the door is locked. So perhaps we could call this attempt to control.

"Free Will", then, is the combination of these two things, Prediction and Control, in a feedback loop.

We can think of measuring prediction by seeing how accurate and how far into the future you can predict.

We can think of measuring control by seeing whether your actions accomplished their immediate task.

Thus, we can think of measuring potential Free Will by a combination of these two -- looking at how accurate and far you predict, and how you successfully control based on those predictions.

Finally, we can think about Kinetic (or Active) Free Will, which is when you actually exert free will by predicting and controlling the future.

== A Call To Arms ==
You have before you several tasks of betterment available, based on the above definitions. Ultimately, the idea is to increase your Kinetic Free Will.

* Improve your ability to predict
** Learn how to learn
** Learn skills
** Use the scientific method -- it is at it's root all about predicting
** These days it's all about using models to predict. Learn about that.
* Improve your ability to control
** Practice!
** Increase the number of variables at your disposal (number of knobs to tune)
** Feedback into your predictions
** Eliminate nondeterminism wherever possible (and beneficial?)
* Put your Potential Free Will into action
** Actually make some predictions and apply control
