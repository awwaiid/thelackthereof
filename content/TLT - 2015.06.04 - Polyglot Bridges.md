Tags: Polyglot, Ruby, Perl6, Python

Here are the [http://thelackthereof.org/docs/talks/2015-06-14%20RubyNation%20Polyglot%20Bridges/2015-06-14%20RubyNation%20Polyglot%20Bridges.pdf slides for Polyglot Bridges (pdf)] lightning talk that I gave today at [http://rubynation.org RubyNation].

The most important bit:

```
# Shell
sudo apt-get install matplotlib
gem install rubypython
# pending a small patch for debian/ubuntu 64bit

# Ruby; even works in the REPL!
require 'rubypython'
RubyPython.start
plt = RubyPython.import('matplotlib.pyplot')

plt.plot([1,2,4,6,28,50,234])
plt.ylabel('some numbers');
plt.show
```

Or in other words: pull in this [https://rubygems.org/gems/rubypython rubypython gem], magically get all the python libs callable from Ruby. In this case, you get all the nice charts and graphs from pyplot. I originally played with this in [https://github.com/niner/Inline-Python/ Perl6/Rakudo Inline::Python], where it also [https://gist.github.com/awwaiid/ef3f0abcfa96e34977b4 works fantastically].

I love the idea of one community NOT completely re-writing a library in their language when it can just be used "directly" instead.
