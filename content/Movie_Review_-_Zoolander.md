We were reluctant to watch this movie at first because it seemed like it would be stupid. We were either extremely right or extremely wrong. Since our first viewing Beth and I have probably watched this movie at least a dozen times... and it just doesn't seem to get old!

Though Adam contributes to our madness as well.

This movie is hilarious. Watch it. Or die in a freak gassoline fight accident!
