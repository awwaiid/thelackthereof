Sometimes when I'm programming it's a lot like being in a dream. This is most apparent when something interrupts me, pulling me out of the dream world. I'm groggy at first, unsure of what is really happening. Slowly I adjust, addressing the interruption.

Then, when the interruption is over, I try to go back. But you don't always dream the same dream, and I can't always remember where I was and what I was doing in the program. I have to ease myself back into it until I finally let go and once again lose myself.
