The idea that most changes in a genotype are neutral -- that they do not affect the phenotype or only affect the phenotype in a fitness-neutral way (see [[Genotype-Phenotype Mapping]]. This provides for wider exploration of the search space making it easier to find a genotype which requires only a small change to improve fitness of the resulting phenotype.

Roland does a lot with Neutral Evolution, and others are doing a lot with it too.
