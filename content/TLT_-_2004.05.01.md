Well I set Jill up to be my primary computer and turned off Feline. All part of getting ready for the move. So now that I have no music I decided to turn KJACK into my personal jukebox (thank god for VNC).

Got a bunch of boxes for books, so we're almost done with that.

Liz is visiting. She and Jason are fighting but she has a bunch of schoolwork to do so she stole his car and came up here. Adam will be here soon to visit (for the week pretty much). We are going to hike the canyon a bit on Monday together, which I'm looking forward to.

The most important things that I have left are: Abstract Algebra Test. Abstract Algebra Essay. Abstract Algebra Homework. Human Rights Research. Light study for Buddha test. Study for Math History test.

Not bad.
