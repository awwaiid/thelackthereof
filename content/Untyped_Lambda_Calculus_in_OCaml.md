I wrote this specifically so that I could use it as a genotype in [[OGPF]]. I'm not sure that I ever actually did that... but I'm not dead yet!

It seems to work pretty well, and there might even be some comments in the code. This might be a reasonable example of how to write a lambda calculus parser and interpreter in OCaml.
