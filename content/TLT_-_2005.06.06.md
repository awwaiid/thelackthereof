Work at [http://www.swca.com/ SWCA] is going very well. I have a whiteboard and PowerBook and everything. I've done a port of [[Continuity]], or at least the philosophical core, to PHP. Perhaps Steve will let me open source it... but right now I'm too busy using it to publish anything.

Here is the summary of the world:
* Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith - Sucks
* Ongoing AJAX craze - interesting but scary
* [http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html Intel Inside Apples] - interesting but scary
* Mirabel down for a few hours today - sad
* Daily Show - good
* Monk (TV Show) - makes me happy
* Sherlock Holmes - same
* PowerMac G4 - nice, especially the battery life... but I'll stick with Jill
* Rabbit - DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN I'M TRYING TO SLEEP

Stupid rabbit. Kept me up most of the night yesterday making chewing sounds. Grr. I woke up downright angry.
