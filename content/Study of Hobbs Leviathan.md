We've started a book club to study political philosophy, and are starting with Hobbes. Here are some random notes.

## Part I
Mostly setup I think.

### Chapter 6
Defines lots of vocabulary, including Good and Evil.

Starts to build a language to talk about the state of nature.

### Chapter 7
About the goals of discourse.

Science vs Opinion.

Even opinion has some structure, but science has more.

### Chapter 8
Goes on and on about madness. One interesting thing is he talks about group-think -- a nation which is mad where the individuals are only a little mad.

### Chapter 9
Breaks down the areas of knowledge.

### Chapter 10
Power is based on the ability to control people. Which is driven based on the people being controlled -- their willingness to be controlled.
