The Wheels Turn. A monome norns+arc four track inspired recorder.

## Concept

The idea is to have four audio tracks that we play back and record against, one assigned to each wheel (knob control on the Arc).

See the project on [github](https://github.com/awwaiid/rotae_versantur)

Equipment:
[Monome Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/) (though I technically have the [Monome Norns Shield](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/))

[Monome Arc](https://monome.org/docs/arc/)

## Instructions

* Use the Arc to visualize and control a four-track recording and playback machine
* Button release
  * Toggle Rolling vs Stopped
* Turn a Wheel
  * Set [MODE] for that track
  * Amp, Pan, Reverb, Tone
* Button + Wheel 1
  * Seek
* Button + Wheel 2
  * Set MODE
  * Amp, Pan, Reverb, Tone
* Button + Wheel 3
  * Select recording track
* Button + Wheel 4
  * Select bounced tracks, they then feed recording

## Thoughts

This is a non-DAW setup, the idea being that we want more than a single recording but less than the distraction of an overly powerful computer. Four track recorders have been used to make a lot of great things, they appear to be sufficient for some complex pieces. Why buy one when I could buy something even more expensive and write some Lua and Supercollider code?
