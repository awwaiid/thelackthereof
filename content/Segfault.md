== Lyrics ==

There's a little gremlin
Living in my code
It sneaks a line in here and there
To make it all explode

I try to make it happy
I try to treat it right
Don't drop it into water
Don't feed it at midnight

And yet it still awakes
Removing malloc here and there
It tries to make me crazy
And to pull out all my hair

Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?

Tell me is that memory
Yours or is it mine?
Did I just miss a malloc?
Is it something more divine?

Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?

Sometimes I think I see it
In the corner of my eye
All the hairs stand up on my neck
When the gremlin is nearby

I know it came in the night
And messed with all my code
Cause it worked just fine yesterday
And now it will not load

Now I'm waiting for the moment
I know it will come soon
When everything is working swell
And then it all goes boom!

Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?

Tell me is that memory
Yours or is it mine?
Did I just miss a malloc?
Is it something more divine?

Who's fault is my segfault?
Who's fault is my segfault?
