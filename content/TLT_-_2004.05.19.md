Heard back from Dima - he says it is crazy around there and he will hopefully be able to tell me (tell me when I can come meet, I assume) on Friday. Though perhaps he meant he can tell me if I have the job. Wouldn't that be nice?

I've been applying for lots of [[Jobs]]... full customized cover letters and everything. I'm very tired of it. I miss Beth. I'm lonely without her, even though I have people here to hang out with. Lightyears away from being the same as having Beth. :(
