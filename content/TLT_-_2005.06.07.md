Yesterday I neglected to mention [http://www.debian.org/News/2005/20050606 Sarge was released]. One of Beth's complaints about linux is that I'm always changing things. So I've had her on testing for a while and now I'll move her over to stable. Then nothing will change for like 3 years!

At work I'm working on this timesheet application. The structure was put into place previously, but I've made some significant alterations to the internals. Well now that I've got things worked around, once again it goes back to user interface design, which is always an interesting challenge -- even in what many would see as something mundain. The subtlties involved are numerous.

Core to the struggle is the tradeoff between useability (with little to no training) and productivity. The goal is to have an intuitive interface which doesn't slow down the experienced users. People will be using this on a daily basis, so its pretty important that they don't have to click through friendly messages reminding them of what they can and cannot do.

Reflecting upon the solutions posed by others in the desktop application world, we see that there are a variety of methods to bridge the gap. First is a good help/documentation system. Every screen has a help button that will tell you all about the current part of the program, its features and limitations. Lovely little screenshots and links to more in-depth topics.

Then there are tutorials. These go hand-in-hand with the help system, and often the tutorial is somewhere '''in''' the Help. There are of course many depths of tutorial... and if something much deeper than an overview of nuances of the system is required I'm not sure that this is the right idea. In other words, if the going through the tutorial is the only way to figure out the application, perhaps the application needs to move a bit toward the intuitive side of the gap. Besides, "tutorial" is another way of saying non-supervised training.

Two more. Next is having a per-user set of preferences. Then you can have users and power-users. Or even just different ways of approaching the problem to be solved. I'll have to think about this more (in regard to the applications I work on).

One thing I see in a lot of applications are first-time-usage messages. So the first time you run into the overtime issue extra documentation appears to let you know what is happening.

These are all obvious things when it comes to desktop apps, but they are missing in a lot of web-based applications. I suppose I just need to continue letting go of the static-webpage ideology and embrace the application.
