The new battery that Chris bought me as a graduation present came yesterday. It is slightly bigger than I expected (2600mAh instead of the 1400mAh which I had before). I charged it up all night and then tested it this morning. I ran at full LCD brightness and a pretty steady 25% CPU load from fully charged to completely dead (I let Jill die). I began the test at 6:13 and the battery died at 8:28... 2 hours and 15 minutes. This is WAY better than I imagined!

Once it is charged up again I'm going to do a low-brightness and low-cpu test. Oh, and the USB netgear MA111 wireless card which I got to work is randomly making the machine lock up when switching from wall-power to battery-power (unrelated to the new battery).

I wish I could tell how much a specific device drains the batter. I am wondering if I should run my test with the USB-wireless disconnected. Hmm.

And here I am outside of Rob & Patty's house. This battery lasts almost 3 hours under normal usage is my conclusion. I'm a happy duck!

I talked to Dima and I am going in tomorrow afternoon to talk about an offer they will give me. Very good news.
