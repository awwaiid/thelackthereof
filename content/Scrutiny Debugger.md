After giving a talk on debugging techniques, I started wondering why I (and many others) don't use the debugger in perl much... but generally do use the debugger provided by other systems (firebug). The general idea I came up with isn't that using a step-based debugger is flawed philosophically, as I had initial suspected. Instead I think it is just because it isn't at our fingertips.

This project is an experiment to bring a debugging tool into a popular perl application chain - Plack/PSGI middleware.

Code: git clone http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/Plack-Middleware-Scrutiny/.git
