Applied LLM Demos; basic token output visualization with graphviz

![Basic token tree](img/Basic_token_tree.png)

* **General Status:**
  * At the hub today!
  * Delighted to keep meeting and chatting with people, went to lunch and all that
  * I organized an Applied LLM meetup -- there were demos that were DELIGHTFUL! A lovely enthusiastic group :)
* **Nerd Snipe:**
  * Flipped my bluetooth mouse (which I hadn't used since switching to Sway) to left-handed
  * My conference room presenting connection on this laptop has thrown me; Sway/Wayland won't let you have merged screens and the jabber speaker/mic doesn't output any sound for me! I need to do a more controlled practice run, the one I did wasn't good enough
* **Alloy+LLM+Rails Project:**
  * I got initial graphviz output!
  * I then decided that it was too slow to generate, so started to get my intel GPU to work
  * I ran into this exact same issue and gave up
  * Then I started figuring out how to spend money renting someone else's computer
  * ... now I have to be careful. I spent $4.50 pretty quickly. I have a budget for this, but I want to spend that on actual computation instead of forgetting to turn something off and letting it run all night or all weekend for now gain
  * Unfortunately the output didn't work for my first larger run; the nodes in graphviz didn't have the full path and overwrote each other
  * Also I think that the local one can go a lot faster if I don't fully reset it every time; there are savepoints and some other things that might work
  * Still -- it's close to being GUI-able!
