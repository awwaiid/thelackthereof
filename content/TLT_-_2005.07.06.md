You may have heard that [http://www.nasa.gov/ NASA] recently executed its [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main/ Deep Impact] mission in which it collided a spaceship ("Impactor" -- about the size of a coffee table) into a comet. At first I thought to myself hm, that's interesting.

Then today I was reading an article on it which mentioned that this is the first time a man-made object has crashed into a comet. Suddenly the full irony of the situation hit... I mean... WE SMASHED A SPACESHIP INTO A COMET TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN!? NASA is damn cool. I can just see those guys sitting around a table discussing this six years ago. The intern in the corner was like "I have an idea..."

Soon <i>we</i> won't be the ones fearing space debris. Rather, the space debris will be the ones fearing <i>us</i>.
