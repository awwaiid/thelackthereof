== Intelligent Robots and Programs==
In our current internet society the word 'Bot' has been used for software robots. At some point I decided that I didn't want to end up like the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation employees - "a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came."

So I think that, when they arrive, we should refer to intelligent robots as "Robits" so we don't hurth their feelings by implying that a robot is a robot is a robot. I figure we should start now before it becomes a problem!
