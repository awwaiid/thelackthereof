From http://wikipedia.org/ we see that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism Platonism] can be defind along these lines:

<blockquote>
Platonic idealism is the theory that the substantive reality around us is only a reflection of a higher truth. That truth, Plato argues, is the abstraction. A particular tree, with a branch or two missing, possibly alive, possibly dead, and initials of two lovers carved into its bark, is distinct from the concept of a Tree. A Tree is the ideal that each of us holds that allows us to identify the imperfect reflections of trees all around us.

When I first look at this definition of Platonism I certainly don't think that I'm a platonist. People are pattern-matchers, getting the idea of 'Tree' from all the examples of trees which have been presented to us. We don't have a deep grasp of some higher true reality.

That is, of course, until we consider Mathematics.
