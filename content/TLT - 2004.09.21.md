I just noticed http://www.hostingsoftware.net/, which is a direct competitor to http://eggplantfarms.org's own system of custom scripts and [[EPFarms Panel]]. I'll probably go ahead and install it to see what it's all about, but from the description it is definitely not an abandon-ship worthy project. Sounds like there are a couple core design decisions that we decided upon differently. Interesting none the less.

I'm very excited about the new Mirabel! Pieces have already started to arrive in the mail. The only one that seems like it will be slow in getting here is the powersupply.

Time to wake up Beth.
