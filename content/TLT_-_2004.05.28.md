Well I got the job at http://openratings.com/ -- a very good thing since now I can actually be here permanently and have beth and the rabbit come out and all that. I'm VERY HAPPY! I went in earlier today and talked to Dima, looked around the place and all that. They should send out the official offer letter soon, and I should start on June 7th.

Happy days! Now I can spend the next week doing nothing and enjoying it. Well... finding a place to live and a way to get to work and all that. But still. I can already feel myself typing faster.
