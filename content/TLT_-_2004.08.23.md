A friend once told me that you can put a person into one of two categories -- a Beetles Man or an Elvis Man. I told him that this was stupid and that he couldn't force me to choose one or the other and that it wasn't right to put people into such categories. The topic has come up from time to time since then ([[Brock's First Law]] and all)... and each time I pretty much say the same thing.

Just now I was listening to http://www.bootliquor.com/ radio, and something suddenly became very clear to me. I am an Elvis Man.
