Sorry to add to this post so long after you wrote it, but I wanted to
thank you for your ecumenical comments about Vim. You managed a minor
miracle: you praised your favorite editor without starting a flame
war! 

I'm one of the strange folks who happens to love both Vim and Emacs.
Vim is lean, mean, and beautiful in its simplicity. Emacs is
monumental, endlessly extensible, and mind-bendingly self-referential!
I've learned a lot about the power of good software from both editors.
