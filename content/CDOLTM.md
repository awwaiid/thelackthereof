(Cats Dominate Our Lives Too Much)

audio:docs/music/album1/08_-_CDOLTM

Wake up
Feed me
Don't wait
I need
You've got your own world
But you brought me here
Suck it up you worthless whore
I feel like you
Don't care
Be kind
Shut up
Leave me
I know that you think
I am here to entertain
My attention is not free
Sometimes you can be
So vain
Tease me
Be touched
Give me
Wake up
Feed me
Don't wait
I need
You
