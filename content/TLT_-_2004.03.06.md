left:memorex_mp3_player Today I got a new CD/MP3 player which I'm having fun with. A long time ago I backed up about 30 gigs of mp3s to CDR disks which have been sitting on my desk ever since, so I had some MP3 cds ready to play with. I just now checked on the net and there are some wonderfully bad reviews of this player and how it breaks very quickly, but also it seems there are two revisions and that I have the second one. So we'll see I guess. You can [http://www.memorexelectronics.com/EN/pops/products_pop_windows/mpd8400a.htm see the specs] if you like.

We also saw Starsky and Hutch today. Not as good or funny as Zoolander, sadly. Oh well. It was fun anyway. AND I had an eye doctor appointment and ordered new glasses and contacts. Busy day, eh?

I've been working on the Eggplant Farms Panel application. I'm trying to put together ideas I mention in [Thoughts and issues with web-based DB programming], though this is not just a web-based DB app. So far it is going swimingly, as you can see at http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/epfarms-panel/. It is nice to have a project so that I can put some of my ideas into code.
