Notes listening to the Changelog interview with Cory Doctorow on Chokepoint Capitalism.

While driving to and waiting for Millie (the car) to get maintenanced, I listened to [Examining capitalism's chokepoints](https://changelog.com/podcast/535), an interview with Cory Doctorow discussing his book [Chokepoint Capitalism](https://craphound.com/category/chokepoint/). This touched on all sorts of things, but right up at the front was an off-topic question -- How is Corey so prolific?

Among some other things Corey suggested that ... well, that practice makes perfect. And that instead of just copy/pasting a link into slack like I usually do that I should write up some notes trying to capture, for other people, what I found interesting or special about the link. So yeah. Good idea. Let's do that.

Problem: I don't really have or want "blog" software. I ran my site as a publically-editable wiki for like 20 years. It is now a nuxt-content-driven static site, basically. Super easy to open a file in vim and edit more-or-less markdown. But do I do that? No, not really. So of course then I'm like ... if only I could run a command to pop open my editor and start writing writing writing away. Great!

Turns out I already did that, made a horrid little shell script that goes like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set +x

FILE_DATE=`date '+%Y.%m.%d'`
TEMPLATE_DATE=`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`

TITLE=${*:-Untitled}
NEWFILE="TLT - $FILE_DATE - $TITLE.md"

echo "Creating: $NEWFILE"

cd ~/tlt/thelackthereof/content
cp -n "Blog Template TLT - 2023.01.01 - Blog Template.md" "$NEWFILE"
perl -pi -e "s/TEMPLATE_TITLE/$TITLE/" "$NEWFILE"
perl -pi -e "s/TEMPLATE_DATE/$TEMPLATE_DATE/" "$NEWFILE"
vim "$NEWFILE"
```

But now if I'm thinking of Corey's advice I might actually be juggling several drafts or jot down some partial thoughts. Next thing you know I'm trying to write a CLI in Typescript (for reasons) and .... not writing a blog post. As my niece says, The Struggle Is Real!!!

Anyway. Where was I. Oh, capitalism.

I've been playing with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) a lot, and even set myself up with the paid version to play with GPT-4. It's a fascinating tool and interesting to explore. I find that to get interesting or useful things out of it I must change what I feed in. It isn't really like a Markov chain bot or an Alexa Q&A .... it is more like a brainstorming tool that has been fed The Internet. Right off the bat I can't really expect answers that The Internet doesn't know, especially technical ones. If there is no hint of an answer on Stack Overflow, probably not going to come up with one here. Next you have to feed it some context. If you ran into someone in a caf√© and asked them to give you an itinerary for a vacation that you're going on they can do it, but they'll do a poor job if you don't give them some information about your tastes and goals.

A big part of this is exploring for myself the question -- now what? What comes next? What do we do with this? How will it change things?

A lot of my friends, acquaintances, and connections on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@awwaiid) and elsewhere discuss how these Large Language Models are violating their creative and copyright rights by slurping it all in, mashing it all up, and spitting it all out (sometimes without so much mashing) without citing their original. Some of these same friends thing that [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) was over prosecuted in exfiltrating JSTOR science articles. I guess my sympathies are mixed here ... I want people to be compensated for their labor and creativity, and I want information to be free, and I don't want monopolistic middle-men to leverage the advantage in the middle without adding value. I personally publish most things under a license that explicitly or implicitly allows my content to be republished, remixed, etc, ideally with a citation. But I'd be happy with being cited as being an incorporated part of every output -- I think the LLM publishers should say "Here is the dataset that we trained on and every contribution into it". And then I'd even be proud to be part of it.

Then we get back into the podcast -- what happens when humans are not only augmented by machines, LLMs among them, but above that they are _controlled_ by the machines? Corey calls this the Reverse-Centaur. Further what happens when the economic system is further twisted to where you are stuck in this situation, controlled by monopolistic possibly-non-value-adding-middle-players? This he calls Chickenized Reverse-Centaurs. They break down in some detail what this currently means, and it is scary. I have to remember how good of a position I am in, celebrate it, and see if I can help others have some control over their own lives as well.

Still -- the Centaur concept is powerful. Tools can help us do things faster and better. Having the right tool for something can change a project from hours to minutes. I'd like to know how LLMs can accellerate us, and selfishly me, in day to day life.

I sometimes discuss Global Warming with my father-in-law. He thinks it is a scam, on many and various levels. I generally take the mainstream view that we should probably be more scared than we are -- though I further think that we should accept the fact that the Earth is increasingly a garden and that we need to make it an awesome one. Anyway, he sends me some long and somewhat complicated videos on climate science and alternate models. Youtube has transcripts. Feed the transcript to ChatGPT and have it give me a summary and critique some of the points.

But can I trust it?

One of the differences between modern Capitalism and Ideal Capitalism is that Ideal Capitalism is founded on the idea of information transparency. Efficiency in a market is all about setting the right price based on all the right factors, as I understand it. So what happens when we don't know the real cost of something, like Global Warming? The price is too low. But what happens when we have the _wrong_ information, when things we think are true are actually bad summaries from an LLM that have added a bit of false-detail for fluidity. When humans do that on purpose it is fraud, corruption, embezzlement, scams. Will LLMs and similar technology accidentally amplify that, making markets even less efficient? Not to mention efficient and humane are not the same thing. Ahhhhhhh.

So many things.
