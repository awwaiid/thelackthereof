More fun with my website. I renamed Brock's Journal to TLT, like I used to call it. I'm not sure if I should call my log that or not. Just calling it my 'log' is boring, I think... suggestions?

I should be working on a paper right now... but I'm not. It was due last thursday. Fun.

22:24 - a day later

I can't decide what timezone I should post things on... UTC? Local? My previous standard was local... but that always anoyed me for after-midnight posts. UTC is even more annoying, separating day posts from night posts. For now I will stick to local time, but I might eventually change to sunrise = new-day mode.

I was right, I should have been working on that paper. I ended up skipping my first class and working on it then. Turned it turned out OK. Now I'm doing it again studying for my math test tomorrow. Here are some theorems for you:

; Sylow E: $$ Syl_{p}(G) \ne 0 \mbox{ if } p | (|G|) $$
; Sylow C: $$ Syl_{p}(G) $$ consists of a single conjugacy class.
;; Cor: $$ P \in Syl_{p}(G) $$ $$ P G \mbox{ iff } Syl_{p}(G) = \{P\} $$
