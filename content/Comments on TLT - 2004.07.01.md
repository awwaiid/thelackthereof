I believe the word you are looking for is ''refactoring''.

Also may I point out that good code probably does ''not'' read as a good book, although it probably is ''readable''. 

Take the example of Knuth's [http://literateprogramming.com Literate programming]. He thought that there are two sides to every code: the ''story of the program'' and the ''program itself''. This is why he made a meta-language to describe both at the same time, and two programs to extract either one from the meta-description. The ''story of the program'' reads like a book. The ''program itself'' reads like a program. As they are obviously different, the ''program itself'' does not read ''like a book''. Good code is readable but in a different way.

Yes... you have a good point. Though I was replying to something (which I can't recall now) I think that I did draw the similarity between a book and code a little too closely. Maybe I could say that code should read like a good outline?

I guess good code reads as — ah, well — ''good code'', so think about a new readability type.

Btw, a recent good read is [http://shatters.net/celestia/ Celestia]. It's amazing to see how such a convoluted thing can be read so easily. Thumbs up for the authors.
