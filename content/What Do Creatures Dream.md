  What do creatures dream?
  Can they tell the difference
  Between a dream and reality?

  Even we
  Somtimes
  Cannot

  When we awake in the night
  soaked in fear and sweat
  ready to run for our lives

  When we solve the problem
  we'd been stuck on
  for days?

  Does the dog dreaming
  of catching his prey
  wake up happy?

  Does he fight his friend
  if just last night
  he was being attacked?

  Does the baby bird
  learn to soar
  the same way we did?

  Dream it first,
  try it awake,
  then succeed?

  What if we did not dream?
