Move To DC! Here's how:

* Why to go
** School
** Work
* Where to live
** [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=washington+dc Google Map]
** [http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm Metro Map]

Northwest quadrant recommnded

that would be dupont, foggy bottom, adams morgan, columbia heights, etc.

columbia heights can be sketchy

adams morgan can be like mill ave on speed

dupont is gay gay gay all the way way way

* What to do
