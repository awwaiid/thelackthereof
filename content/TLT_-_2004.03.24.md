LOL. From http://freshmeat.net/projects/snowpath

<blockquote>
<b>Snow Path Formation Simulator</b> 0.5.2 (Default) by Matthew Strait<br>
Snow Path Formation Simulator is a program that models the process of people forming very distinct, and yet not always altogether logical looking, paths in the snow as they walk across open spaces. The evolving condition of the snow is displayed graphically. <i>This project may eventually mature into a screensaver</i>.

(Emphasis added). I should put that last line at the end of all of my projects!
