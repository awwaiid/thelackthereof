Drawing up some ASCII art diagrams of the internal Continuity control flow, these are my two best variations so far. First is a bit too tall:

Too tall because it doesn't quite fit on a 24/25 line high terminal. Here is my revised version, which not only fits but is also more accurate in the relationship to the "Your Code" nodes.
