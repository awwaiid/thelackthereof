Walkin' down the road,
Thinkin' bout my code all the time,
The way that I'm walkin'
People might think I was blind,
When I get stuck,
I just keep a walkin' down the line,
'Cause nothing gets me down,
When I got code on my mind.

Pound Bang
/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
print "Hello World\n";
Gimme Perl and a Unix shell,
I'll code right through that dinner bell

Everywhere I go,
Thinkin' bout my code all the time,
Even at church,
Vim can seem so divine,
And when I'm makin' love,
I keep thinking of my next line,
'Cause nothing gets me down,
when I got code on my mind.

I think about it,
when I get up,
The time awake just ain't enough,
So I turn to sweet caffeine,
Just a little more is all I need,

Walkin' down the road,
Thinkin' bout my code all the time,
The way that I'm walkin'
People might think I was blind
When I get stuck,
I just keep a walkin' down the line,
'Cause nothing gets me down,
When I got code on my mind,

Pound Bang
/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
print "Hello World\n";
Gimme Perl and a Unix shell
I'll code right through that dinner bell

Nothing gets me down
When I got code on my mind
