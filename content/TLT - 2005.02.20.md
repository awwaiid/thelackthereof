Made some progress on my Perl backend for [[OGPF]]. I keep thrashing though... still not feeling great about the whole structure. I keep thinking that I should just start over, yet it is quite clear that it would be a mistake. It works, and it works pretty darn well - just needs some tuning.

Or better yet some feedback. What I really need is someone ELSE to actually use the thing. But the likelyness of anyone else using it in its convoluted state is pretty low. I suppose I should focus on how well it works for me :)
