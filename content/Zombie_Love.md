  Hey sweetie

  I miss you
 G            D
  Why did you run away?
 G
  Through good times
 D
  and bad times
 G               D
  that's what we used to say

 Refrain:
 G# jam ....

              G#
  I WANT YOUR BRAINS
 C#           G#
  I WANT YOUR BRAINS
 C#           G# C#
  I WANT YOUR BRAINS
                G#
         ZOMBIE LOVE

  Sometimes when
  you're sleeping
  I moan outside your door
  Though my heart
  Ain't beatin'
  Be yours forever more

  [refrain]

  Shoot at me
  Scream at me
  Why won't you just die?
  I tell ya
  I'm dead dear
  And I can't even cry

  [refrain]
