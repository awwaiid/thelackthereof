Title: POE/Reflex vs Coro/AnyEvent

Abstract:
A head-to-head comparison of two disparate concurrency management systems in Perl5. Strengths? Weaknesses? Cats? Dogs? You decide.

Current plan: nperez will represent POE/Reflex, awwaiid will represent Coro/AnyEvent. Each will get 15 minutes to introduce background concepts, and will then do some direct comparisons with feedback from the audience!

Comments to organizers:
Joint talk with nperez. I believe we are open to editorial suggestions!
