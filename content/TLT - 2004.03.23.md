Sheesh.

Just got back from my Women's Studies ([[WST]]) course. Very depressing. We talked about "comfort women" in Japan... Korean and other women who were sex slaves to the men on the front line (against their will). Not to say that Japan is the only ones to do this, of course. We watched a movie which turned my stomach.

We went to the store and got food stuff. While there I saw one of those lighters with the long necks and decided to get it... we have candles which end up being pretty deep and it would be easier with such a tool.

But then when we got home and I tried it out I realized that I had purchased a flame thrower! I think this is an anti-wind thing, but it is pressurized and makes a hissing sound as it wooshes the flame to a sharp point several inches away from the tip of the lighter. It is very scary!
