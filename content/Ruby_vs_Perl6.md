In [http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/digging-into-ruby-symbols.html Digging Into Ruby Symbols], Steve Yegge talks about dynamic code generation in Ruby. He says that Ruby doesn't go far enough in giving you access to the language itself.

My understanding of Perl6 is that this sort of thing will be embraced and encouraged. i think that Ruby culture might see such things as scary, whereas the Perl culture is ripe with the proven desire to jump at the opportunity.

Put well in a [http://use.perl.org/~Mark+Leighton+Fisher/journal/28955 journal entry] by Mike Keighton Fisher.
