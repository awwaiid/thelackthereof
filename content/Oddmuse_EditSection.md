This extension adds an "[Edit]" link to sections, so that you can edit them one-by-one. This is to clone the feature in http://www.wikipedia.org/.

For now this depends a bit on the oddmuse plugin (because it uses == ... == as the section identifier, basically). That means that it has to be loaded after oddmuse... hence the 'zzz-' part of the name.
