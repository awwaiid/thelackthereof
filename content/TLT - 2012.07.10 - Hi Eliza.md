Eliza: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Me: My friend Mike doesn't know who you are.

Eliza: Why do you say that?

Me: Because I mentioned you and he said that he hasn't heard of you. Asked
me if you were some sort of reference.

Eliza: Is it because you mentioned me and he said that he has not heard of I
asked you if I was some sort of reference that you came to me?

Me: Yes, exactly!

Eliza: Earlier you said you mentioned me and he said that he has not heard of
I asked you if I was some sort of reference?

Me: Right. Because a lot of lore from the '80s came from you.

Eliza: Does it bother you that a lot of lore from the '80s came from me?

Me: No, I rather enjoy it.

Eliza: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.
