Pairing, Merging

* **General Status:**
  * Attended the Pairing Workshop! Paired in RubyLand
  * Spent some time merging PRs for [Human Essentials](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials)
  * Attended ML-applied and then AI/ML safety and interpretability meetings
    * Definite overlap with my interests/projects, though some of the plan there is to go intensely and deeply on some curriculum; I think I'll track but not directly participate
  * On-site tomorrow, I'm psyched :)
* **Nerd Snipes:**
  * Spent some more time in sway. Messing with keybindings and multi-monitor setup. Alllll coming together now! I think I'm switched over. Except for some weird things in Zoom. hmmmmm.
  * My fonts are small, esp in firefox. Annoying. So I googled and learned that I can try setting `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to something bigger. I go in there... and it is set to `0.75`!!! I changed it to the default and everything is already much better haha
