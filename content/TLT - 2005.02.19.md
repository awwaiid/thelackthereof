Roman numerals annoy me. After some brief research on the internet (especially see [[Wikipedia:Roman Numerals]]), I've discovered that the way I've always considered "standard" is not necessarily so. Unfortunately the Superbowl does it the way I don't like... so I'm afraid the status will be commited forever!

It comes down to this (from [http://wikipedia.org wikipedia]): "Some rules regarding Roman numerals state that a symbol representing 10<sup>x</sup> may not precede any symbol larger than 10<sup>x+1</sup>. For example, one should represent the number "ninety-nine" as XCIX, not IC. However, these rules are not universally followed."

I would like to thus publically state that I am one of those non-adopters of that stupid rule. As far as I'm concerned we recently had Superbowl IXL. And you just know its all the fault of those marketing people because (1) they learned it the stupid way in school, and (2) MORE X's PEOPLE! Everyone loves X! X X X!!!

Bloody Romans.
