Oh no. This actually made me cry. I haven't seen him in ages, but he was definitely loved. Give Beth and her mom a hug for me.

Brock and Beth, I was SO sorry to read about the loss of the Dane. I have oftened wondered why it is so painful to lose our animal "people" and I have decided that it's one of the ways the Universe keeps us humans REAL when we tend to close ourselves off from that in our objective realities... I feel your sorrow.
