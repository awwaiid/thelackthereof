Well Mirabel's harddrive went down a bit so we had to move all of her services to pointless. Not fun. But amazingly here I am... tlt is back up and running already (once DNS reaches you). I lost two pages but no real work (some stuff about [[Contize]]). David and I stayed up late last night moving things. Its probably not perfect but it seems to be a wonderful temporary solution.

So PHP5 was released this morning, and after a very brief investigation I found that [[Contize]] can be implemented for it using the new __call method for objects... looks like it will have to be a proxy object thingie just like the perl one (intercepting method invocations, doing some magic caching, all that jazz).

Pointless (machine we are using instead of Mirabel) is a slow but steady beast. We got just about everything running on it now. Looks like it's harddrive failure, so we will get a new one, reinstall here, and then send it to the colo, and they will put it in the box for us. They're quite nice.
