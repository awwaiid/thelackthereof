A delightful song about that one shoe you can't seem to find!

Lyrics by Brock, music by Brock, Jason, and Elizabeth.

I got one shoe,
Lookin' for the other,
Got one shoe,
Lookin' for his brother,
Got one shoe,
Lookin' for the other,
Well there ain't no shoe in sight!

How am I gonna get to school?
How am I gonna get to work?
I better find that shoe real soon,
Or else I'm gonna go bezurk!

I got one glove,
Lookin' for the other,
Got one glove,
Lookin' for his brother,
Got one glove,
Lookin' for the other,
Well there ain't no glove in sight!

How am I gonna get to school?
How am I gonna get to work?
I better find that glove real soon,
Or else I'm gonna go bezurk!

(Musical interlude)

I got one sock,
Lookin' for the other,
Got one sock,
Lookin' for his brother,
Got one sock,
Lookin' for the other,
Well there ain't no sock in sight!

How am I gonna get to school?
How am I gonna get to work?
I better find that sock real soon,
Or else I'm gonna go bezurk!

I got one shoe,
Lookin' for the other,
Got one shoe,
Lookin' for his brother,
Got one shoe,
Lookin' for the other,
Well there ain't no shoe in sight!
