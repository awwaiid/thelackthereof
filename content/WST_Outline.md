Outline for WST

= Domestic Violence =

A. Definition by our organization

Battering is a pattern of coercive control that one person exercises over another. Abusers use physical and sexual violence, threats, emotional insults and economic deprivation as a way to dominate their partners and get their way. Relationships in which one partner uses assault and coercion can be found among married and unmarried heterosexuals, lesbians, and gay males. Battering is a behavior that physically harms, arouses fear, prevents an individual from doing what she/he wishes of forces her/him to behave in ways she/he does not want to.
