Just got me a SGS2 from T-Mobile only to quickly discover that the T-Mobile version is actually a slightly different phone than the unlocked SGS2... not necessarily a bad thing since the max 4G speed is higher and the screen is a bit bigger. But very irritating when I went to drop Cyanogenmod on it.

* T-Mobile model is "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II#T-Mobile.27s_Galaxy_S_II SGH-T989]" (instead of I9100)
