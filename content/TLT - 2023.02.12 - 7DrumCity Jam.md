Second time renting a practice room at 7DrumCity!

## The 7DrumCity Space

[7DrumCity](https://www.7drumcity.com/) is a DC (for-profit) community center for music. They host cool events and activityies, as well as rent out space for practice. I guess they've been around for a while now, but I only heard of them last year or so. Back in September 2022 I rented The Orange Room when Jason was visiting. The room comes with a full drum kit set up and ready to rock! It also has a bunch of amps, a synth, a mixer, and penty of noodles to plug it all together.
