So I got a response back from Dmitry (Dima) from http://openratings.com. He asked me to solve a little problem so he could get a feel for my background -- decide whether a given datastructure is a proper BST (Binary Search Tree). He preferred C but said another language would be OK.

So [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/misc/btree/btree.c here] is my solution in C and [http://thelackthereof.org/projects/misc/btree/btree.ml here] is my version written in OCaml. The OCaml version took me all of 5 minutes (if that), but the C version took me longer to get all my pointers and such correct... I guess if you don't use it you lose it.

Feedback is welcome. I am quite rusty on my C!
