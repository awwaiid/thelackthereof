(2011.07.05)

I dream of code written
And of code yet done
I dream of recursion
Of loops and jumps and fun

The twisty tricks and all my wits
Fell just within my grasp
Beyond my mortal limit
Moving oh so fast

Soon I will awaken
The structure starts to blur
Daylight physics much more strict
Still I happily endure
