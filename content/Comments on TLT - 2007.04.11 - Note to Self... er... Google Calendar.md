Nice captcha.

  use POSIX 'strftime';
  strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S");

Thanks (for both the compliment and the code).

I guess that's what happens when things start out as a one line shell script and turn into something slightly bigger...

BTW, that works better as strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S",localtime) (it demands the time argument).
