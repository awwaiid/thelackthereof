Lately on all the mailing lists and articles I note people doing langauge comparisons and leaving Perl out. This is quite frustrating, because often Perl exemplifies whatever it is they are discussing. Gar!

I'm tempted to start replying each time I see that. Maybe I'll make a new username dontforgetperl or something specifically for that trolling. They are guilty of this a lot on [http://slashdot.org/ slashdot] (of course), but also over at [http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/ Lambda The Ultimate]. Eh... I'm just bitter.
