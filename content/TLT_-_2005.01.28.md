So the folks over at IlliGAL started a genetic-programming blog, http://www.illigal.blogspot.com/. I think its super cool! In like one day they've generated more interesting GP tidbits than the mailing list has generated in quite a while. Unlike the mailing list, the detailed information in the blog actually makes me feel inspired to write down the thoughts inside of my own head.

So i did something super cool the other day, I created a smalltalk-like browser for perl (see [[GOE]]) as a module in the [[EPFarms Panel]]. It was such a simple thing to do... and yet it seems to have so much potential. The first thing I want to get going is this: when you get an error now (a panel-module crashes for example), the system emails me. Well what I want it to do is to detect whether the person logged in is a developer, and if so give them a link to directly see the code which caused the error.

I'm going to [http://codecon.com/ CodeCon] in a few weeks, and I'm quite excited. One of the many interesting projects being presented is [http://wheatfarm.org/ Wheatfarm], which was my inspiration for the above hack. It is a wiki/object system/web-based-programming-envirionment. Interesting... but I'll stick with Perl for now :)
