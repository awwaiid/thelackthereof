hrm. bleh.

Well, looks like the comment hack for the questionasker extension does something bad and sucks up tons of server memory. Until I fix it comments won't work... if you want to leave a comment (even on a comment page) just edit the page!

I noticed it was broken last night, so I turned it off because I was showing a the wiki off and wanted all the features working. But turned the questionasker completely off... just between then and this morning I actually got more SPAM! Crazyness. So far I have gotten zero spam when the QuestionAsker is turned on though... hrm.
