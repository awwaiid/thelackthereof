I finally got a new PCI video card for Feline a few days ago. Now my dual-monitor configuration is actually usable. Previously I had a 4mb card, which isn't enough to actually display webpages in any sort of pretty way. The cheapest card that Fry's had was a 64meg card... which is better than my 'good' card :)

I made some progress and a release on [http://continuity.tlt42.org/ Continuity]. Scott and I will be getting together soon and jamming on a couple things. My preferred interface is now stable enough that I'm going to start developing some actual applications, starting with an inventory manager for work. Hopefully I'll be able to even do some [[DOM Templates and AJAX]] stuff.

Beth started school this week! So far so good. Looks like this semester is going to be much more enjoyable than last. I'm going to try setting her up with a wiki (or similar) to manage her notes. Being organized during the semester is going to help her lots.
