Since that article is not in the top section, it was probably up for a short amount of time. I wonder how many Reddit users go there every day (I do). It may have only linked a handful of people to that essay.

I like Reddit a lot. Since finding the site, I've got over my Slashdot habit. I find that the entries are of much higher quality than Slashdot.

One obvious thing about reddit that I've realized since then is that it has a much more volitile pulse. That is -- right now there are cool articles because most readers and voters are fans of interesting things (especially LISP). I'm not sure the site will be able to sustain its overal interesting nature if the audience grows or changes.
