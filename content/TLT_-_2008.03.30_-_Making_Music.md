I love to create and build -- lately I've made a few songs! My friends like to play guitar and sing, and I play the harmonica and am learning guitar. So here are my recent creations (all with the help or in conjunction with friends):

* [[Umbrellas]]
* [[Zombie Love]]
* [[Immaterial Things]]

Only the middle one has a recording posted so far, but I'll get recordings of the others sooner or later. More to come I hope :)
