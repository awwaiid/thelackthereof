Today is Beth and my 1-year anniversary! Sort of sad since we aren't together today... but we will be together soon and celebrate :)

No word back from Dima yet... I hope to interview ASAP so that this can be final (one way or another). Today I'm hitting the job applications extra hard as a backup plan. As Rena or Adam or someone said... its easier to not have a job or have a job than to be looking for a job.

While I was searchng I ran accross the Worcester Computer Co-Op (http://www.worcestercoop.org/index.html) which I think is super-cool. If I ended up around here I would definately donate some time there. They even use debian :)

So there is a post on Craig's list, http://boston.craigslist.org/eng/31160135.html, and I am trying to decide whether it is serious or not. Its for a web developer -- PHP expert and knows lots of other things like C++.

Then it says "The job is full-time. Youâ€™ll spend approximately 20 to 30 hours a week as a developer and the remainder of your time filling out other critical roles within the organization: mail room, running errands, answering phones, light cleaning, etc."

hmmm....
