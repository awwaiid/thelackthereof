Hanging out in phoenix at Liz's. Red Sox won... I was recruited as a Red Sox fan while in the Boston area in the early summer. Perhaps the addition of one more fan has been just enough to raise the curse? We'll see soon enough.

Liz has a neighbor below her who plays very loud deep mexican um-pa music, and he just started it. Considering that it is just getting to be 1:30AM, even the usual flexible, let people do their own thing ideology I have weakens and I have the urge to stomp or go down and yell at him. Liz asked the apartment people to talk to him, but that hasn't helped yet. Maybe he should move his bass away from the wall a bit or something.

So. Yeah.
