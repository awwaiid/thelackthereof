== Lyrics ==
Girl with Pi tattoo
I just wanna sit next to you
Only reason I stayed in school
Was the girl with Pi tattoo

Across the room
I see you staring at me
Depth of your eyes
Like infinity

You show that Pi is real
And there's no end in sight
I'm so impressed
Can we study tonight?

Girl with Pi tattoo
I just wanna hang with you
Only reason I stayed in school
Was the girl with Pi tattoo

Final test
We study all night long
After every proof
Another hit from the bong

Did I write down
Or was it all in my mind?
Seeking truth
It's only answers I find

Girl with Pi tattoo
I just wanna go home with you
Only reason I stayed in school
Was the girl with Pi tattoo

Girl with Pi tattoo
I just wanna make love with you
Only reason I stayed in school
Was the girl with Pi tattoo
