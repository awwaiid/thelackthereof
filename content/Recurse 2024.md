I'm attending [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) for 6 weeks from March 25 - May 3.

* [[TLT - 2024.01.31 - Recurse Setup]]

## Project Idea

I'm going to explore the intersection of Alloy+LLM+Rails, or more generally how to leverage LLMs to bring "formal methods" into the Real World. My general hypothesis is that (a) Formal Methods (such as model checking) are valuable, (b) they are too costly to use IRL, and (c) LLMs can help bridge that gap. We'll see :)

## Layered timeline

I'm thinking of having a rough schedule that will be default way to decide "what should I be working on".

* 6 weeks
  * Work as an iteration for each week
  * Set a goal, make a set of tasks, burn them down
* 5 days a week
* 6 hours a day
