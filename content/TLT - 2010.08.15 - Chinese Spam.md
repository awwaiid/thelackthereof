Ever since I got my terminals and mutt all working well with international characters, I've been fascinated by the Chinese spam I get. First of all it looks neat to see in a terminal. But sometimes I throw it into google translate just to see what it is I'm getting spammed about, and every now and then it's mildly interesting. Take this for example:

<blockquote>
任可一种管理绩效的产生，首先都是原于一种先进的管理理念。而任何一种先进的管理理念都必须有一种适合它的管理模式作为载体。人们似乎都很乐意去接受先进的理念，并且善于以最惊人的速度去传播。可是人们在践行的过程中得到的结果却是参差不齐。就象丰田的精益理念早就传遍了整个世界一样，而世界却始终未能复制出第二个“丰田”。这究竟是为什么呢？主要原因在于人们虽然已经接受了新的理念，却没有能够找到其精髓的所在。因此也就无法去设计一种适合自身需要的管理模式来作为载体
</blockquote>

Which translates (probably very poorly since it is machine translation, but good enough for bloggin') to:

<blockquote>
Either a management performance can be produced, first of all are the original in an advanced management concept. The possession of any advanced Management philosophy that it must have a suitable management model as a carrier. People seem very willing to accept advanced ideas And good at the most to spread at an alarming rate. But people in the course of practice the results obtained is mixed. On Like Toyota's lean philosophy had already spread throughout the world as the world has never been able to replicate the second "Toyota." Is this why? Although the main reason is that people have accepted the new idea, but not able to find its essence Lies. Therefore will not be able to design a management model for their own needs as a carrier.
</blockquote>

As someone who has been involved with companies who adopt Lean-like philosophies, I couldn't agree more!
