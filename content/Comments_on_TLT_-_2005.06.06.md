Intell in Apples doesn't really bug me.  They make reasonably good CPU's and I think Apple /still/ suffers from "Not enough MHZ" symdrom in the consumer market place.  Further, while the Power4 is a really f'ing nice chip, it was never on the radar for my next cpu, even with real vector instructions.  Dual opterion running linux *mmmmmm*.

Too many people know just enough to have been taught by Intell that MHZ is all.

I love you because you said "downright".

PeeEss: Tell Miss Elizabeth that some customer has made 'recommends' lists for all of her father's books and put them up on display. It's kind of creepy.

Hearts!

I'm a fan of amd as well. I heard that IBM was also giving apple trouble in meeting supply orders on time. (hey -- sign your name so I know who you are)

For all those others out there, Mandieshead refers to wikipedia:Michael_McCollum, the science fiction author and my father-in-law.
