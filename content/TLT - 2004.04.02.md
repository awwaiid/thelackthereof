I think I've finally figured out how to get a 'recent songs' list for http://www.kjack.org/.

The software they use doesn't have this feature, but it does have an error log which will mention what file name was just played. Unfortunately this filename is something like MUS00032.MTS, which scary and says nothing about the artist or anything.

Fortunately these files are mp3s.

Unfortunately they do not have id3 tags.

Fortunately I found their DB which stores the translation guide -- the artist and title to the filename.

Unfortunately it is a proprietary format.

Fortunately I can read it without too much trouble.

Unfortunately all this crap is on the wrong computer

And finally -- the breakthrough that I just realized -- I am fortunate enough to completely control the server now. Which means that I can do such whacky things as mount samba shares! So all I have to do is share the right couple spots of the drive over samba and then I can have a script rip out the appropriate bits from the two files. Neato, eh?
