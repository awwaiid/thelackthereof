Here is a nice quote I picked up from http://www.bagley.org/~doug/ocaml/Notes/okoans.shtml.

<blockquote>
Michel Mauny was giving a guest lecture to new computer science students. After the students were seated, Michel pronounced "Today's lecture will be about Lazy Evaluation", he paused for a moment then concluded with, "Are there any questions?"
