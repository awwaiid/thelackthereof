I wrote my first useful stand-alone javascript thingie! I've always wanted a combo drop-down in HTML... and for one project I'm currently working on it was especially appropriate. Yet again I set out accross the web to look for the perfect fit, but didn't find what I wanted.

But I've been doing this whole Javascript thing quite a bit lately, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Using [http://bennolan.com/behaviour/ behaviour.js] to attach events cleanly, I whipped up my very own [[DHTML Combo]]. Then I realized that it didn't work quite right.

Simple problem really. My combo is <i>literally</i> a textbox and a listbox. The listbox is normally hidden, but when the textbox gets focus I display the listbox. Then if you mess with the listbox it gets focus. Problem: when the list gets focus, the textbox loses focus first. Normally when the textbox loses focus I want to hide the list again. But not if they are actually trying to maniplate the list!

No problem though, I did a quick little setTimeout timer to reverse the events. Now when the textbox loses focus it waits a bit and then checks to see if the list is the thing that got the focus. If not it hides the list. Seems to work pretty well. Using [http://tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/ ies4linux] to test (wine+ie all downloaded magically and working rocks) it even works in IE!

Maybe I should put it on [http://www.openjsan.org/ JSAN].
