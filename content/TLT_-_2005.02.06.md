Arg. I turn my QuestionAsker extension off for less than two days and I get SPAMed! I'm turning it back on and fixing it so that people can add comments again. My previous idea was to allow comments without the question, but the recent spam was added to both my sidebar AND to the comment section on my sidebar. Evil.

The thing is, that in general the question-asker is annoying. One idea I just had is to do a one-time question asker thingie... where the login for the Editor mode is the question, and thereafter (so long as you are logged in) you do not need to answer the question. This still isn't as easy as no question at all though... hrm.

So I got the [[QuestionAsker Extension]] to work on comment pages, and I bypassed it for my tracker stuff. Grr.
