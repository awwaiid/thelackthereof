We've started a book club to study political philosophy, and are starting with Hobbs. Here are some random notes.

== Part I ==
Mostly setup I think.

=== Chapter 6 ===
Defines lots of vocabulary, including Good and Evil.

Starts to build a language to talk about the state of nature.

=== Chapter 7 ===
About the goals of discourse.

Science vs Opinion.

Even opinion has some strucuture, but science has more.

=== Chapter 8 ===
Goes on and on about madness. One interesting thing is he talks about group-think -- a nation which is mad where the individuals are only a little mad.

=== Chapter 9 ===
Breaks down the areas of knowledge.

=== Chapter 10 ===
Power is based on the ability to control people. Which is driven based on the people being controlled -- their willingness to be controlled.
