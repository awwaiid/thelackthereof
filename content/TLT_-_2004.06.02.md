Just spent the afternoon wandering down to the [http://www.tatnuck.com Tatnuck Bookseller], about two miles away. Pretty nice place... though no free wireless. I think they had paid wireless. Don't know enough to hack it... looked like a borked IP grabbing trick.

So today is Wednesday... then Thurs, Fri, Sat, then I move in to my new place, then I start my new job. It's getting close.

Worked on [[SetDB]] while I was there. Finished up my graph module integration which clarified the code quite a bit. Now I need to clean some other existing code. I'm working on adds... I had them going once but only simple ones. I think I know how to do complex adds now. Then I will go back to [[EPFarms Panel]] development and perhaps write a SetDB::WebWidget module... this would act like the dbform stuff I did for PHP. Except better.
