I noticed a link on [http://lambda.weblogs.com/ Lambda] talking about [http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=116 multi language development]. That is mixing and matching programming languages in one large project. My nature says "yeah!" and that I'm all for it. But then I hesitate...

So my two favorite languages, as you may know, are [[OCaml]] and [[Perl]]. I have on occasion thought about using both of these languages in a single project. This has never happened, however, and for a good reason. These languages are at very opposite ends of the world. Perl is flexible and dynamic and weakly typed. Ocaml is strict and static and strongly typed. Why I like these two languages is another story (see [[Why I love Perl and OCaml]]). The point I'm trying to drive here is that it doesn't make sense to me to combine them directly.

What ''does'' make sense is to join them in a more abstract way. For example, one of the planned features of [[OGPF]] is a remote perl-based user interface for monitoring and controlling the system. This is a different sort of language mixing, and one which I suppose is being addressed more directly in the above article. There are packages such as cpan:Perl::Inline which do the sort of direct mixing I speak of, however.

Well... I'm not sure where I am going with this. I'll get back to you.
