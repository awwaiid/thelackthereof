Got a game going with Jason over at the [http://www.dragongoserver.net/ Dragon Go Server], should be fun.

Started some more work on [[OGPF]] last night. I keep going back and forth between using the untyped-lambda-calculus implementation and doing a full OCaml/MetaOCaml method. I'm going with the lambda-calc (again). Implementing a tic-tac-toe competition. The immediate plan involves trying things like seeding the population or starting from scratch, trying different sizes of population, etc. The longer term is to create a disparity between the genotype and phenotype and start doing some neutral evolution.
