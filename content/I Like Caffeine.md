I like caffeine
From my favorite bean
Makes me want to sing
I like caffeine

Once upon a time
There was a mime
Town called Sublime
Only had a dime

No-where to go
Feeling pretty low
At the corner store
Bought a cup o' Joe

Late for a train
Hiding from the rain
Met the perfect dame
Never caught her name

In a sunshine ray
Standing down the way
Pulling shots all day
Made a mean Latte
