I'm finishing up at work. Played around with some CSS with mandies and also worked with Aaron on evil MSAccess. The other day I noticed http://mda

This is Mandies, on the twenty-third of the great month of February. Brock left this open on my machine, and I take that as an invitation to finish the entry for him.

As much as I hate wikis, I have to admit that Brock's done a "decent" thing with his. (That's the highest compliment you'll <i>ever</i> hear me give toward a wiki in their current implimentation, by the way, and you should be honored.)

I love Brock and Beth. I'm going to follow them around like a puppy dog.

That is all.
