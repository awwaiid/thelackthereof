Just finished watching [[Movie Review - Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan]], which I'd never seen before. Well... at least I don't remember seeing it before. I've certainly seen bits and pieces, and have definately seen the last bit with Spock. It was pretty good.

Yesterday was Beth and my fourth dating anniversary and around now is our 6 months of marriage day. We've mostly spent the weekend watching movies and hanging out together.
