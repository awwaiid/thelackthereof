I was reading some random news article and noticed an advertisement with a cool logo from http://www.rackspace.co.uk/ and so I went to the site to get a better look. Pretty good looking, I thought, so I left it open so I could show Chelseya sometime.

About 5 minutes later a Java Applet popup appeared -- a live chat system with a real person telling me that they were a website guide and asking if I wanted any extra information. I told them to go away, of course, but it was interesting non-the-less (I also disabled java). I wonder how widespread this practice is... whether there are a lot of other folks doing the same thing. If I was <i>actually</i> looking at them for business I certainly would have felt special to get a live person. Yet there is a feeling of intrusiveness...

Its like when you go to a store and a salesman meets you at the door and hovers. And you tell them you are just browsing, so they go away... but only a few steps away and you can sort of feel them breathing down your neck the whole time you are there. Do they watch which pages I go to and how long I stay there? Creepy.
