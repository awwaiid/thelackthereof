  it's dark here now
  you're far away
  you're still within
  the light of day
  
  waiting, waiting
  it's all i've got
  i cannot be
  what i am not
  
  no self-fullfilling
  prophecy
  can come between
  my love and me
  
  i must become
  one with the tao
  but you're far away
  and it's dark here now
