(er... Actually I meant to post this sometime back in like February 2010. Oh well!)

I attended the [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/ Orlando Perl Workshop 2010] and had a lovely time. The talks I attended were:

* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2499 Stevan Little (stevan) - Untitled No. 12]
** I only saw the end of this, so I can't really comment :) . It did mention Plack a bit.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2476 Shawn Moore (Sartak) - Surviving in the Cruel, Unforgiving World]
** A discussion of his (and other's) nethack bot, including some discussion of the internals and some strategy lessons.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2509 Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (miyagawa) - Plack: State of the art web framework superglue]
** Introduction to Plack, you know, a neat layer to interface [http://plackperl.org/ Perl and a Web Server].
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2477 Cory Watson (gphat) - From Zero to CPAN: Adding A New Product Search to Magazines.com]
** Both a discussion of search indexing via Solr, and talked about how he put some of the more generic libraries they used up on CPAN. This one is most likely to impact my day-job.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2510 Lucas Oman (lucas) - Roles in PHP?]
** Yep, Lucas got roles of a sort working in PHP. But the syntax is a bit ugly. Cool anyway though.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2483 Dylan Hardison - How to Debianize a CPAN Dist]
** I'm hoping to maemo-ize some stuff, which is a lot like Debianizing it... so this was handy.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2497 Marty Pauley (maokt) - Perl can be FUN(ctional)]
** Fun stuff about closures and functionally things ala Higher Order Perl
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2466 Matt S Trout (mst) - The Troll, the God and the Mountain]
** Epic! Ultimately about Collection Management tools (which is an expansion of ORM more or less) that are in the works.
* [http://perloasis.org/opw2010/talk/2463 Mark Keating (mdk/markie) - Keynote: The awful things we all must do and the most disgusting word you'll hear]
** A pep talk for the community to do some good Perl Marketing!

And... I got to see aligators! Well... things that looked like them anyway.

My whirlwind trip wasn't too stressful, as it turned out. I hung out mostly with Sartak and Miyagawa, and made lots of progress on cpan:Continuity::Adapt::PSGI. Lots of side-discussion on all sorts of things too, of course.

It was a good weekend!
