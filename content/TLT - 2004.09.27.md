Just chugging along here. Practicing my harmonica to whatever comes on -- went form "Bad Moon Rising" to "I'm Too Sexy" for an interesting transition. Curtis has returned to work after a weeklong vacation.., no meltdowns while he was goine which we are all happy about. Work is still going very well.

Mirabel is frustrating, as usual. We put her together on thursday/friday, but of course she didn't work. David and I figure it is probably the motherboard, but we are going to try to get a second opinion in-town before we send it back to http://newegg.com. Wish us luck! I'm _really_ looking forward  to getting it all working and sent off to Florida-land.

Beth and I went down to Phoenix this weekend to send Jason off, he'll be leaving next weekend for DC. We'll go visit him next summer or so I hope, him and Erik et al. I've never been to DC, so I'm looking forward to it. Oh, and speaking of trips we're contemplating going to Idah to visit my family for Thanksgiving.

Doo dah... too sexy for my cat...
