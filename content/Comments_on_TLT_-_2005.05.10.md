Some of those vaio stories are pretty funny.

Seems like your new job is easier to swallow morally than the last one.

I actually had to google to pass your human test.  I am a bad human.

Which test was it? Some of them are a bit independent... but as a secrent hint you can try hiting reload to get another one :)

Why <em>is</em> a raven like a writing desk?

I miss you guys. Semester hell is finally over and all is well. How's Beth doing? And are you guys coming down to the valley or are you working there via Flagstaff?

Leslie Gurney came into the store a couple of weeks ago. She's a D&D Dork now, which cracked me up. It was great to see her again, though, since I hadn't since before your wedding.

Happy Anniversaryishness, by the way. (I know I'll forget over the next few days. :p)

Aww... its a MANDIES!

I will pass the happy-anniversary on to beth.

We are coming down the the valley. specifically I am already down in the valley, and beth will be joining me soon. We will stay at beth's parent's house for a bit, and then get our own place before too long. So then you can come and chill with us in tempeland.

Then we need to have a party and attack the world. Tell Beth that the Bookmans in Phoenix is hiring; it's barely-livable wage, but an awesome job. :)

Mad hearts and such.
