So Damn Cute

audio:docs/music/so_damn_cute_v1

Practice using [[Rotae Versantur]]

Well I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
and when the people ask me why
well the question is moot

because I love you dearly
from your head to your toe
and if you're going somewhere
well that's where I'll go

because I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
and you might ask why
well I'll tell you the truth

It's 'cause you're so cool
and you're so nice
and if you asked me on a date
don't need to ask twice

when you come a round
I just lose my head
when I hear your name
my whole face turns red

because I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
because I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
because I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
because I love you
'cause you're so damn cute
