What do you dislike/hate exactly ? I find this trilogy just so excellent, a great moment and even more so when it was released. I have since read the book at the origin of this film.
No, really, we have big action scenes, a neat scenario, cool actors, ...

I haven't seen it in a very long time now, so can't remember. Probably I was being dramatic in my review :)
