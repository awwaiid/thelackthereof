Abstract: Before the United States Civil War, Louisiana's sugar production grew from barely noticiable amounts to 264.000 Tons due to an increase in both domestic consumption and output capacity. It proved unable, however, to counteract the expansion of Caribbean exports. This study contends that the slave-owning << hacendados >> had to operate in a very dynamic market in which they were culturally ill-prepared to compete. Their ethics based on individualism and sense of independence deriving from their slave-owning condition, was an obstacle for associative efforts. Thus they acted on an article-by-article trade strategy, causing demand saturation and price dumping which led to the weakening of their individual and collective position in the sugar trade.

* Title: Revisiting Du Bois: The relationship between African American double consciousness and beliefs about racial and national group experiences 
Author(s): Lyubansky M, Eidelson RJ

Document Type: Article 
Abstract: This study revisits Du Bois's concept of double consciousness by examining the relationship between racial and mainstream acculturation and African Americans' beliefs about their racial and notional groups. Surveys completed by 100 prospective Black jurors at a municipal courthouse approximately 6 months after 9/11 revealed that they perceived their racial group as more unjustly treated and more helpless than their national group but believed their- national group was more vulnerable and more in need of maintaining a distrustful posture than their racial group. in addition, beliefs about racial group vulnerability, unjust treatment, and superiority were stronger for those respondents more deeply immersed in Black culture, whereas engorgement with mainstream culture was unrelated to the strength of these convictions. In contrast, both racial and mainstream acculturation tended to predict beliefs about the American national group in the domains of vulnerability, injustice, distrust, and superiority.
