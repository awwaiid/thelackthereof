Pinpoint is some pretty fun slide software that I like. Homepage: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Pinpoint

== My Slide Software Criteria ==
* Mostly-live edit, ideally in vim
* Simple markup, ideally diffable
* Big word centered in screen by default
* Not too ugly
* Export to PDF
* Open-source, duh. Ideally via apt-get

Pinpoint additionally has:
* Associate/run a command for the current slide
* Presenter mode (though I don't use this often)
* Easy drop in videos
* Can record the time to help pace the presentation

Pinpoint workflow:
* Copy over a simple .pin file to start along with my boring blue fade background
* Start pinpoint
* Edit file. Saves jump to the first-edited-slide
* Before I present, use pinpoint -o to export a PDF and email it to myself
* Practice practice practice!

There are quite a few setups that meet all these nowadays. But I like pinpoint anyway :)
