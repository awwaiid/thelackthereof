I never could figure out what was wrong with my simple-changes sidebar thingie... so I've given up and just hacked around it. Also set up a demo issue-tracker, see [[Create Tracker Item]] and try it out. This whole wiki thing is such a powerful idea... it doesn't take much to make it do all sorts of things. I think I still need to fix my RSS feed though. hrm.

Tomorrow is the [http://www.flaglug.org/ LUNA] installfest! I'm excited. Depending on who shows up and what they want to hear I might give a talk. Just an overview of the major software components in a typical desktop setup. Still fun though.

Getting close to when I get to go to [http://www.codecon.org/ Codecon]...
