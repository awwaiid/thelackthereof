Litterally, the measure of how evolveable a genetic programming system is.

So then comes the question -- what is this?

* Solve complex problems
* Don't get stuck at local maxima
* The longer it is run, the better solution it finds
* Avoid bloat, increase parsimony
* Increase genetic drift so that a current good solution can become an even better solution
