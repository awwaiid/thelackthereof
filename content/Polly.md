I have a mix of ogg and mp3 files, and got tired of switching between mpg123 and ogg123, or worse not being able to play a mix of ogg's and mp3's at the same time. So I went ahead and wrote my very own wrapper.

You can get it at:
* http://thelackthereof.org/projects/perl/polly/

Features:
* Plays ogg's and mp3's!
* Can shuffle the list of songs
* Can do the mpg123 trick of hitting ^C to go to the next song, or ^C^C to halt
* Playlist can come from STDIN if you like
* Extendable! :)
