Had a nice visit with Levi last thursday and then Garrett on Friday. Then on Saturday (while returning Garrett to the Hiller House) I visited family all day, something I'd been meaning to do for a while now.

Still knocking stuff off at work, had a tutorial session yesterday and this monday the entire phoenix office will start using the timesheet prog. Today I've been working on the export directly into the accounting system. All sorts of fun. Though I am on the verge of connecting my [[ODB]] and [[SetDB]] projects :)

Now that Beth and I are in our new apartment I feel much more at-home. Not that living with the inlaws was bad or anything, it's just nice to have our own space and all our stuff set up. Got the internet, goes at about 6mbit. And the Vonage phone. And got our desks all set up.

The craziest thing: Rabbits love stairs! Coco will climb the stairs, run a lap around the office, and then shoot back down to the livingroom. It is sooo cute. He likes the new apt too, apparently.
