Interesting weekend. Among other things I got a new release of [[Contize]] out to CPAN, with some minor changes all toward getting [[Continuity]] to work. And today I released cpan:Continuity, which I'm very pleased about :)

Now I'm trying to drum up some people to push me into furthering this project. So far no such luck. I'll make a couple more example programs, as I need them, to show how the thing can be used. If you build it they will come?
