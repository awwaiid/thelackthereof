Went over and hung out with Scott (of Phoenix.PM) a bit, working with him on [[Continuity]].

Then came back and tinkered a bit. Now the server can support multiple apps and users at once! And my inventory demo is a full CRUD app. It's amazing what just a few lines of code can do.

Last night I went to the [http://plug.phoenix.az.us/ PLUG] Developer's Meeting. It's close enough to here that I'll try to go more often. More experienced, professional types there, as opposed to at AzPHP and Phoenix.PM where we have a larger variety. Hard to say that for sure, of course.

Beth and I got a new pet! Woozle! Woozle is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig Guinea Pig] (looks like the one on the right a bit). So far Coco and Woozle don't care about each other much (though Coco is a bit territorial, and Woozle wants to escape from anything that moves in a misguided effort to return to his cage, not realizing that the only way back is to actually <i>let</i> me catch him).

WOOZLE!
