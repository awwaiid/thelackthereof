Beautiful, southern-facing one bedroom with huge sun in the highly sought after Iowa condominium. I truly loved this apartment.
    OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY, May 26, from 1:00 - 3:00.
    ADDRESS: 1325 13th st., NW, #404 (13th and O). Code = #4040.
Incredibly sunny, beautiful place with hardwoods and tile. All new appliances; washer-dryer and dishwasher in the unit; beautiful cabinets; huge walk-in closet; lots of shelves in bathroom. It is very nicely appointed as I renovated it to live there myself, until transferred out of DC.

The location is fabulous. Steps to 14th street, with the Whole Foods, great bars and restaurants and funky shops. I walked to Dupont Metro to work, no problem (about 6-8 long blocks I think)

If you want more information you can email me on wardenstaci@yahoo.com or email my current tenants c/o Sarah at sarashon@gmail.com. You can also email her if you can't make the open house and need a private showing.

    Available: Monday, June 4th
    13th St, NW at O st., NW
