Well, updating an existing entry doesn't work, because lj is nice and caches the entries. So now I have to explore getting around that. Hrm.

Anyway. Midendian is on his way to the orient!

left:Test_Image I take it back, it did update! woo hoo! Well then, I guess I don't have to do anything special after all. I think it updated, anyway. Oh well... I'll just move forward with the assumption that it does update.

Well, since I wasted this entry anyway, I might as well test out some stuff. Here is a [[image:Test Image]]. Here is a local link, [[Projects]]. Here is a web link, http://wikipedia.org, and here is a named web link, [http://wikipedia.org wikipedia]. Fun, eh?
