Well I've been spending lots of time on my [[Resume]] and am pleased with the current results. Now the next trick is to get a good cover letter or three going. Unfortunately I understand the formula behind resume writing, but I don't have a clue when it comes to writing cover letters.

I may have a lead working for [http://ximian.com/ Ximian], which would be fantastic. I figure that they must have a use for me somewhere. The trick is to (a) find out where they need me, and then (b) convince them that they need me there.

Tomorrow is the NAU Engineering Job Fair, so I'll go to that and practice a bit, maybe make some contacts. Oh, and it is going to snow a bunch too. Great fun!
