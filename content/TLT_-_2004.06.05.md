Yesterday went to Harvard with Patty and today went with Patty and Rob to the Aquarium. Both were nice little trips, and I got some photos (which I will put up someday).

Oh, and yesterday we went by [[59 Bacon]] and I got some [http://thelackthereof.org/

[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18948-2004Jun5.html Man smashes town with homade tank] is a great article. Basically this guy lived in a small town and was mad at a bunch of people. This was mostly due to a zoning issue -- they built a concrete plant accross the street from his small business against his vote. So a few years later he had lost his business, was in significant debt, and then his house burned down taking his snowmobile with it... he just snapped.

Fortunately for him he happened to have a bunch of metal plating and a 53-ton Caterpillar D9 bulldozer... he put two and two together and got a tank. Then he drove through the cement factory, through city hall, completely leveled the newspaper building, and finally smashed into the department store. The department store had a basement or something which the front end of his tank fell into, getting him stuck. That was 4:30 on Friday... cops worked all night with welders and small explosives to open the tank and when they finally did it appears he had commited suicide. A sad end to a sad day.
