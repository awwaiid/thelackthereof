Well it turns out the stupid motherboard we got for the New Mirable does in fact REQUIRE registered RAM! EVIL!!

David picked up a stick last weekend and we tested it last night and at last we have a working machine. It'll still be a while before it is live -- have to order all new ram now, and then of course we have to send it back to Florida. But I'm very excited and soon will be recruiting new members all over the place. Saturate this machine and then buy another! That would be great :)
