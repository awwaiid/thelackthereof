Describe the new page here.
Sweet... the soundcard in my Vaio isn't broken after all! See http://modular.fas.harvard.edu/z505he.html, where they mention the issue. Basically the connector to the sound card, which sits about where my left hand rests, comes loose. First goes the speakers, then goes the headphones. Exactly my issue. In fact, now that I know about the problem I press down on the spot and my sound magically returns! Now I just need a clean table to take jill apart and she will be as good as new!

I am now employed with [http://www.swca.com/ SWCA], and so far so good. In-house PHP programming, building on some nice clean existing code. I'm very pleased with it so far!
