I'm having great fun with the [[Graph Module]]. Now I can do things like this.
<graph>
digraph {
  "Wake up" -> "Get dressed";
  "Get dressed" -> "Go eat";
  "Go eat" -> "Look for job";
  "Look for job" -> "Get job";
  "Get job" -> "CELEBRATE!";
}
</graph>
Which is probably more fun than you imagine. Unfortunately this particular flow chart has not yet come to fruition. I have another part of the interview next week, I think with Stan but I'm not sure. I've continued to apply at other places but so far nobody is jumping out of the dark corners begging me to come work for them. Yet.

Its very nice here. Green and slightly humid. You should join me.
