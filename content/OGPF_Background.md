=== Why? ===
I noticed that other languages (including Perl) have these lovely little genetic programming systems which makes it easy for people to plug-in various genotypes and strategies to solve a problem evolutionarily. I've been tinkering with my own GP stuff in OCaml (one of the few I believe) and so was already moving in this direction, I've merely decided to formalize the whole thing and document it a bit so that others can partake.

The framework is also an experiment in a modular programming style. It is heavily reliant on functors (parameterized modules) giving it a lovely compartmentized feel. This is both for my own education and because I'm seeking out the [[Right Way]] to do this in OCaml.
