## Lyrics

President Obama
You know you wanna
Get rid of Gitmo
Let all those people go

Maximum security
That's good enough for me
Do it for society
Try them now or set them free

President Obama
You know you wanna
Get rid of Gitmo
Let all those people go

We have come too far
For this to be who we are
Show the world we know
107 left to go

Maximum security
That's good enough for me
Do it for society
Try them now or set them free

President Obama
When are you gonna
Get rid of Gitmo
Let all those people go!

-----

Alternate verses

We're the USA
Leader for today
Show the world we know
Let those people go
