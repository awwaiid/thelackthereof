I'm watching the first video for the [[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/cs440/index.html CSU CS440 Intro to AI]] class, taught by [[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/ Chuck Anderson]]. Man... so far this looks great. In addition to delicious shout outs to Turing and Hume and so on, tossed out a reference to the [[http://xkcd.com/632/ XKCD]] take on some AI concepts. Did I mention that we are using a wiki rather than WebCT as our primary interaction point? hmm!

I haven't seen the video for the [[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~ghosh/courses/cs414-f12/yr2012fa/ CSU CS414 Object-Oriented Programming]] course.
