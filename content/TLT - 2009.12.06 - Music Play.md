I was playing with [http://zyzstar.kosoru.com/?creox Creox] the other day, which can make an acoustic guitar sound electric (amongst other things). I recorded a quick song... but it doesn't sound nearly as electric when I listen to it now as it did when I first recorded it (and now I wonder if I even had my Jack settings right for recording what I was hearing...). But it did end up with a fun crackly sound on the voice I think. Listen for yourself:

"Oh my baby" audio:docs/music/oh_my_baby

And it gave me an excuse to add an mp3 player plugin :)
