Sheesh. I should go to bed.

Well, in any case, I've just completed my initial run of work on [[Oddmuse EditSection]]. This extension makes sections have individual edit buttons, just like on http://wikipedia.org/. Sooooo fun!

The nerds go hacking one by one!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The nerds go hacking one by one!
Hurrah! Hurrah!
The nerds go hacking one by one, right until the night is done
and they all-go-hack-ing
Down.
In the dark.
To get out.
Of this dream.
