# Shares

I use Feedly to subscribe to a bunch of websites and blogs and such. When I see something that is interesting I tag it and bag it. Here is the [raw shares.rss.xml](https://thelackthereof.org/shares.rss.xml). I also share thoughts or commentary on [the 'share' tag](/tag/share).

# Tech Note

Feedly is a bit evil and doesn't give rss feeds for "boards" aka tags of my articles. So I bounce it through zapier and then through a nuxt route to get it to the above link. FUN!
