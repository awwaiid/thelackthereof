# Shares

I use Feedly to subscribe to a bunch of websites and blogs and such. When I see something that is interesting I tag it and bag it. Here is the link: [https://thelackthereof.org/shares.rss.xml](https://thelackthereof.org/shares.rss.xml)

## Categories

* **Cool stuff**: Things I think ... you know ... *cool*
* **Inline dev tools**: I'm interested in developer tooling that is integrated into the application itself, or can be used for interactive testing, or things like `binding.pry` that can be dropped inline
* **ML/AI**: Things that I find interesting in the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence
* **Music & Art Making**: Usually overlapping with code, but not necessarily
* **Organization, Process, Task&Time**: Pomodoros?!
* **Programming learning**: I like to learn about learning and teaching
* **WASM Event Horizon**: The rise of WebAssembly is fascinating ... it is a new target platform on top of everything and may bring my desired "cross-language module re-use" into a practical realm. Be the JVM. Or something.
* **Blog Inspiration**: Things that inspire me to write, in theory
* **Recurse**: Stuff related to the Recurse Center

## Tech Note

Feedly is a bit evil and doesn't give rss feeds for "boards" aka tags of my articles. So I bounce it through zapier and then through a nuxt route to get it to the above link. FUN!
