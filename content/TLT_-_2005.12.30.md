I've been reading [http://reddit.com/ Reddit] quite a bit lately. Its another popularity-based list if user submitted links, basically. They seem to have a pretty good vote-based algorithm for floating interesting things to the top of their list.

Though I'm a bit worried. Sometimes I feel that their list is <i>too good</i>.

One thing that has been floating near the top recently is [http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/ Reflections on Trusting Trust] by Ken Thompson. I don't think I've mentioned it before, but this talk is damn cool, and one that I've enjoyed sharing with others. Yet here it is, right on the Reddit frontpage, for all the world to see!

First of all, how am I supposed to judge how cool people are based on their knowledge of such arcane things when everyone can find them posted so widely? Secondly, how can I share this sort of super-cool thing with folks on a person-by-person basis if everyone already knows?!

On the flip side are all the interesting things floating out there that I know nothing about. Maybe I'm finally getting in to this whole blog-o-rss thing or something.
