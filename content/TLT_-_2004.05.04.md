If you've ever wondered about Fedora (the Redhat derivative), Adam found the perfect explaination: http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2004-May/msg00104.html

I'm studying for my Buddha test. Liz asked me what sort of religious or spiritual beliefs I have, especially in regard to Buddhism and Taoism. I started to explain a bit and inadvertently came up with a new concept of 'soul' -- that souls are really just a person's [[Gravitons]]. Adam encouraged me a bit. So now  I'm developing a new philo-religion based on this concept.

See [[Gravitonism]].
