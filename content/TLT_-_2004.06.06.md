Moved in to [[59 Bacon]] today -- discovered that a neighbor in a nearby house has open wireless :)

The place has now been painted and cleaned and all the junk that was in here last time is gone... and now it is fantastic. It has a sun-roof in the bedroom and hardwood floors in parts and a dishwasher and a freaky-room and all sorts of things. And then to top it all off I discovered the wireless. I'm a happy duck!
