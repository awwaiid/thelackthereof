G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
she's laying in
D
a patch of sun

G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
And I think her day
D                  G
is gonna be a good one

G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
she's laying in
D
a patch of sun

G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
And I think her day
D                  G
is gonna be a good one

C
She's laying there
G
all through the day
C
Just seeing her
G
takes my cares away
C
What she's dreaming of
G
I couldn't say
D
But I bet it's something
G
real fun

G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
she's laying in
D
a patch of sun

G
My little dog
C
laying in my living room
G
And I think her day
D                  G
is gonna be a good one
