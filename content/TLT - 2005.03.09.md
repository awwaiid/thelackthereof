I think that, in addition to xor, we should use "ior" to explicitly mean "inclusive-or". Yeah yeah... I know that "or" alone is implicitly an "ior"... but I just like the sound of ior :)

Doh! I didn't notice that my little edit-todays-entry shortcut was messed up and didn't pad my dates with zeros... oh well.

I've been trying to use KHTML instead of Gecko to do the magical html->ps rendering... and in some ways it's better and in some ways worse. First of all, it is pretty darn easy to get it going, and the KHTML widget is waaayyy easier to use than the mozilla one. But really we should be comparing the KHTML widget to the gtkmozembed widget... in which case they are much closer in ease-of-use.

The KHTML widget, however, has no issues rendering to buffers unattached to the screen (so far). I just now have to get it to print without any screen interaction. The big drawback is that out-of-the-box it has to start all of freakin-KDE in order to do anything... which sucks.

So I plow on!
