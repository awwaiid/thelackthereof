On my way to Safeway, I stopped in at [http://www.filtercoffeehouse.com/ Filter Coffee] to see how they are doing. The nearby Safeway (The Secret Safeway) is closed, but this is still roughly on the way to The Soviet Safeway anyhow. A seat was open so down I plopped.

First they played the entire Rage Against The Machine, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Los_Angeles_(album) Battle of Los Angeles] album, and now we're on to the Ramones with Blitzkrieg Bop. Sounds like they're going to play this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Ramones_album) whole album] too.

Good music, good mocha. Where was I on my way to again?
