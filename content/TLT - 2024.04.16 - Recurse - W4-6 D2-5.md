In-Hub, LLM Club, Mediapipe, Coffee Project, docker-compose

* **General Status:**
  * Went into the hub! So great to see and interact IRL
  * Applied LLM Club we played with a large JSON dataset; works pretty easy to use the ChatGPT UI and upload the whole file, but we didn't find an obvious way to do the same thing on the API. Maybe something with their `Assistants` concept
  * I went over to [Coffee Project](https://coffeeprojectny.com/), pretty delicious
  * Played with [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/genai/llm_inference/android#configuration_options), android AI/media lib from Google, with *JH*. But the bleeding edge software was ... not working
  * Showed *SL* some of how I set up [thelackthereof.org](https://thelackthereof.org) with docker-compose, including nginx running *in* docker with the rest of it
  * I worked on some Human Essentials, really need to wrap that :)
* **Nerd Snipe:**
  * TIL: I am using [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), and you can apparently hit ctrl+shift+b to search backwards up through your scrollback!
  * I upgraded Nuxt to the latest for my static site ... and it now (correctly) gets mad about some internal broken links. But I couldn't find/fix them all so I turned that safety feature off hah
* **Alloy+LLM+Rails Project:**
  * Nice video -- ["Finding bugs without running or even looking at code" by Jay Parlar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvNRlE4E9QQ), though it is focused on the structural modeling not the state modeling
  * Got some communications from the Alloy maintainers; not quite satisfied that we've connected as deeply as I like, but I think I'll be able to get the CLI-JSON output I want in any case
