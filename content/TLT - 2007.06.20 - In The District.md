One day a week and a half ago Beth and I up and moved! Well... I suppose it took a little more planning than just that, but that's what it feels like. We are now living out our dreams in Washington, DC.

I've started a new job over at [http://liquidation.com liquidation.com] which is pretty cool so far. An all Perl shop, which is what I was going for. Unfortunately the timing of the move has caused me to miss YAPC::NA Yet Again :(.

Let's see... our kitties are doing well. In fact, Mia seems to be happier here. Perhaps the very long trip convinced her that life is worth living! Though I don't think they liked traveling they did it quite well -- meowed a bit and then slept all day while we drove.

Pictures coming soon.
