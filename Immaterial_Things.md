Last night I walked
down to the store
Saw something peculiar
On the corner
Standing there naked
wearing all her clothes
Asked her if she knew
I could see her soul

refrain:
She said I get that a lot
I wear it under my sleeve
You're creepin me out, mister
so why don't you leave?
Why so bothered
by immaterial things?

Now I wonder
does she have a point?
Should I reconsider
what I been doin'
Looking at people
with objectivity
I asked her what's wrong
with transparency

[refrain]

So I left
made my way home
turned on the TV
watched the world alone
and it occured to me
that reality
is just a buzzword
for immaterial things

[refrain]
