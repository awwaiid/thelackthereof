== Preamble ==
This naming scheme is a joint effort between Brock, Jason, and Erik. The goal is to have a common file naming scheme so that we can share music.

== Directory Structure ==
Artist/Album/file

Artist and Album have underscores. Actual filenames contain spaces.

== File Structure ==
Generally, files will be named like this:

  Artist Name - Album Name - 00 - Track Title.ext

where the 00 is the track number (zero-padded). Here is an example of the most complicated possible name, including all optional components:

  Artist Name - Album Name - Disk 00 - Disk Name - 00 - Track Artist - Track Name.ext

As you can see, optional components are:
* Disk number
* Disk name
* Track Artist

== Capitalization ==
All the first letters of each word shall be capitolized. All other letters will be lowercase, exept for acronyms of course.
