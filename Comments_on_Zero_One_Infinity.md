See: [[Zero One Infinity]]

At this point I hadn't written many Haikus. This one is an okay start... but I think it is a bit judgemental. More needs to be left to the reader to figure out.

//zero = one = infinity// is one of my "local equations" designed to instigate human-class meta logic. Inherently any mathematical system is either too limited to say anything useful, or strong enough to make absurd proofs like "this statement is false." -- thank Kurt Godel for the proof. So then, its up to us to use logic where it is strongest, and embrace human capacity to be nothing and everything. Often, I notice only a section of the equation is relevant... (zero=one) or (infinity=zero). Gives me poetic perspective that rises above the simple contradictions...

p.s. good thing I know oddmuse so I could figure out your cats' name. You can either turn off comments, or use a question everyone will know. Also, there is a module to hide the wiki links when you are not logged in as an editor.
