Names:
* DCDU - DC Dynamic United
* DDC - Dynamic DC
* DCD - DC Dynamic
* eval (Ä“val)
* late bound

What makes a language dynamic?
* No/little compilation
* Eval

Some dynamic languages/Technologies:
* Clojure
* Javascript
* Nodejs
* PHP
* Perl
* Python
* Ruby

Aspects:
* Open source community?
* Source-code centric
** Aka developer centric
* Celebrate similarities
* Share new ideas
* Libraries, applications, platforms
* Where do you shine, and how can others steal or make it better
* Stand on each other's shoulders

Example overlapping tech:
* pydoc, perldoc, rdoc
* WSGI, Rack, PSGI
* DBIx::Class, ActiveRecord
* Rails, Django, Catalyst, Cake
* CPAN, Gems, pipi, [nodejs one]
* Handlebars, TemplateToolkit
* Pygame, SDL
* Numpy, PDL
* Mechanize
* pypy, rubinius, jpython, jruby, ironpython, ironruby

We don't have a common runtime -- you can't just call a perl sub from a python one. Even within a language you have this issue -- you can't call arbitrary ruby from jruby. Yet we do have in common a set of overlapping problems to be solved and ideas for how to solve them. Let's get together to share (steal!) even more of these ideas.

There are interesting design descisions made between one project and the next within a language, and you get a whole other view when comparing projects from a variety of languages.

Lots of overlapping philosophies and ideas.
* Module distribution / Bug tracking
* Templates
* Math

== Other Conferences ==
* [http://www.dynamiclanguages.co.uk/dlc2011/ Dynamic Languages Conference 2011 (UK)] - "The DLC is a cross-language event aimed at Open Source Dynamic Languages, we hope to bring together all the languages in an open forum to discuss and present the manner in which these languages approach and solve tasks at the cutting edge of development technology" Organized by Mark Keating
* [http://www.dynamic-languages-symposium.org/ Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)] - Tucson, Arizona, USA, October 22, 2012
Co-located with SPLASH 2012. 6th annual ACM symposium. Very notable lack of "perl" in their list of dynamic languages :(
* [http://swdc.se/dyncon2012/ Dynamic Languages Conference (Stockholm)] - cancelled due to lack of particpants

== Dynamic Language and Other (local) Groups ==
* [http://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Lounge-Indy/ Lambda Lounge, Indy]
