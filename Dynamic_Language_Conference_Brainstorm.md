Names:
* DCDU - DC Dynamic United
* DDC - Dynamic DC
* DCD - DC Dynamic
* eval (Ä“val)

What makes a language dynamic?
* No/little compilation
* Eval

Some dynamic languages/Technologies:
* Clojure
* Javascript
* Nodejs
* PHP
* Perl
* Python
* Ruby

Aspects:
* Open source community?
* Source-code centric
** Aka developer centric
* Celebrate similarities
* Share new ideas
* Libraries, applications, platforms
* Where do you shine, and how can others steal or make it better
* Stand on each other's shoulders

Example overlapping tech:
* pydoc, perldoc, rdoc
* WSGI, Rack, PSGI
* DBIx::Class, ActiveRecord
* Rails, Django, Catalyst, Cake
* CPAN, Gems, pipi, [nodejs one]
* Handlebars, TemplateToolkit
* Pygame, SDL
* Numpy, PDL
* Mechanize
* pypy, rubinius, jpython, jruby, ironpython, ironruby

We don't have a common runtime -- you can't just call a perl sub from a python one. Even within a language you have this issue -- you can't call arbitrary ruby from jruby. Yet we do have in common a set of overlapping problems to be solved and ideas for how to solve them. Let's get together to share (steal!) even more of these ideas.

There are interesting design descisions made between one project and the next within a language, and you get a whole other view when comparing projects from a variety of languages.

Lots of overlapping philosophies and ideas.
* Module distribution / Bug tracking
* Templates
* Math
