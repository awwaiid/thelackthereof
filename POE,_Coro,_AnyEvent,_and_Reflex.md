For [http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/ YAPC::NA 2011] I gave a talk, [http://www.yapc2011.us/yn2011/talk/3334 "POE, Reflex, Coro, AnyEvent, .... What and Why"]. Here are the [slides I used for the talk], but they are mostly just large words and there was a lot of talking. The video will appear soon I hope (if it worked), but a written form might be nice -- so here it is!

I hope to give you a very high-level introduction to these four technologies, and a few examples to illustrate their philosophies and usage.

One of the very simple examples I use is called 'sleep sort'. This is a fun little algorithm.
