This is where I'll talk in detail about the 2007 contest.

== Darcs ==
We'll use darcs to share code. It's in apt-get, and here are the basics:

  # Initial get
  darcs get http://server/path

  # Pull updates
  darcs pull

  # Pull updates from a different server
  darcs pull http://server/path

  # Record your local changes (the -l is for also adding new files)
  darcs rec -l

== The Task ==
