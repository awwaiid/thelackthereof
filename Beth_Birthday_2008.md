I was thinking of doing a boat ride on the potomac (like the one Liz did
with her work) to King's Street in Virginia and then having a nice
lunch/dinner there.  But, I'm totally up for anything.  I told Brock "maybe
we should make paddle boats and kite flying my birthday present" and he said
that those things should be considered separate events because "there's no
need to have a holiday for kite flying!"  Haha, but that's also on the
table.  You ladies have any ideas?  I am open like a 7-11.
