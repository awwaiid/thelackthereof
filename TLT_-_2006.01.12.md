<blockquote><i>A brief description of my journey (so far) through continuation-land in Perl. I talk about wanting continuations, faking them, using real ones, desparing at their non-first-class nature, and finally how I am coming out of my depression to create work-arounds.</i></blockquote>

I love [[Continuation-based Web Programming]].

For the un-initiated let me give you the quick of it. A standard (CGI-style) web application is restarted for every single request that the user makes. Users of the app don't realize this, all they see is page 1 followed by page 2 and so on. But behind the scenes, each click the user makes that goes to the application must contain not only the click, but enough context so that the app knows that this user is on step 3. The application must use tricks to manage its own high-level state between user interactions.

This is a bad thing. Or at least annoying. At the end of each state of the application it must explicitly decide what its next state will be. Its like having to having to program with GOTO instead of function calls.

Continuations change all that. While I won't go into the technical details (yet), using continuations switches things around from the programmer's point of view. Its like you suddenly have a new function, display_html_and_wait_for_input().

I wanted this for Perl. But Perl doesn't have continuations. The closest we have is cpan:Coro, which I was initially reluctant to use. Mostly because I wanted serializeable continuations... continuations which can be turned into a string and stuck into a file, which would enable me to run in a pure CGI environment. It seemed like a good idea at the time (and still is, but one I can live without).

Rolling this around in my head for a while, I finally created [[Contize]], a fake-continuation engine for perl objects. Let me explain the thought process that got me there: One essential aspect of continuations is the ability to pick up where you left off. So if I exit my continuation on line 127 in the middle of a for-loop, when I resume the continuation I want to be on line 128. Can't just goto that line though -- all the local variables need to be exactly the same as before. So I'll cheat. I create an object which intercepts each and every method invocation of my application. Then, at any point in time, I can write to disk the steps it took to get where I am. Later I re-run the code, and when I get to a method I've already visited, I just return the cached value instead of running the method. Its like I am recording the session, and then playing it back to get back to where I was previously. The sessions can be serialized, and anything that can be serialized can be duplicated, hence we have magical fake first-class continuations! Very inneficiant, and several side-effects.

I've created two applications using this technique, one in Perl and one in PHP. The technique works, and the overhead isn't actually that bad. My applications are very database heavy, and the database itself tends to be the limiting factor when it comes to performance. Still, loading and storing all this data does have an affect, and the longer the application runs the larger the impact (hey -- if nothing else it has to "play back" more and more code each time).

After using Contize for about two years, I've gotten so used to the side-effects of the technique that they no longer bother me. But they are there. One thing is that most of the code has to be side-effect free. For example, If I do a database interaction I must put it into its own method so that it gets cached and then not run each time the application is invoked. Sometimes this is a bit unnatural.

Another side-effect is implementation dependent. Contize, you see, cached things on an object-by-object basis. So if two objects call each other back and forth funky things happen. This could be fixed by making some sort of global cache, but I'm lazy.

The appeal of using highly effecient, side-effect-free continuations continued to grow. One day I spent two hours on a bug that ended up being because of one of these side-effects. Plus it was just kinda icky. With Scott's encouragement, I finally began working in earnest on a real continuation server using cpan:Coro, which I call [http://continuity.tlt42.org|Continuity].

Things were going along nicely for a while. Because of the nature of Coro, I have it doing its own HTTP serving for now. Other than that though, it is everything I wanted. Fast real continuations in Perl. Until one day I realized that these wonderous real continuations aren't first-class.

First-class continuations allow us to copy an existing continuations, and all of the state that it contains. So, for example, we could create a copy at every point in the navigation of our web-app. Then the back button and browser forking is magically fixed! We just restore one of these saved continuations. No such luck with cpan:Coro.

cpan:Coro does not provide real, first-class, continuations. It has a module, cpan:Coro::Cont, which gives "continuations", but these are really just a simplified interface into coroutines. Namely, I can't create a copy of a running continuation, no matter how I try. Has to do with duplicating the C stack. For a long time I was in denial, but now I've accepted it... unless I re-write perl's core (hello Perl6!), I won't be getting first-class continuations anytime soon.

I then became quite depressed.

When people ask you why you are feeling down, and you explain to them that it's because Perl doesn't have first-class continuations... well people who know me pat me on the shoulders and say "I'm sorry to hear that man" and frown  in sympathy of sorts. People who don't look at me like I'm a weirdo. Maybe I am.

Scott tried to cheer me up. He encouraged me to get on with my life -- to work with what I've got and to get some other things done. There is still alot to do on the whole toolkit. Perl6 will have continuations, and maybe they will be first-class. So we just need to be patient. Realize where we are, be OK with that, and then move forward.

Still, in order to create advanced yet useable applications I need to somehow manage the back button and browser forking <i>now</i>. So with the accepted state of affairs, I began to work on other methods to make things work the way I'd like. I'm still working on them, but there has been some progress.

First comes the back button. A few people have suggested that the "solution" to the back button is to just disable it altogether. While this has been tempting at times, I resist. Sure, there are times when the back button makes no sense, and it is then that it should be disabled. But often I can think of something useful for it to do. But I digress. The answer has come in the way of javascript and that whole AJAX craze. See, I can use javascript to detect that I am viewing a cached page, and then do a background request to the server to let it know what is going on. The server can give back some stuff and I can use DHTML to display the result.

In many ways I think that forked windows are more important than the Back button. We have multitasking operating systems, why not have multitasking applications? In fact, being able to fork a web application is one thing that sets it apart from, and perhaps above, desktop applications. Examining many different items at once in an online store, for example, is completely natural.

The solution to the forking-browser problem comes from the REST folks. People fork the browser by opening links in new windows/tabs. All that is needed is to make sure all the links like this can be deep-linked -- when they open it in a new window I will actually start a new continuation. Open it in the same window and I continue the existing continuation.
