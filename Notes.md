Write a love song in which I demonstrate that someone loves me using a proof-by-contradiction technique. Mention that Bauer wouldn't care for the proof much, but most people would go for it.

Idea: Automatic parser generator (generator). Given inputs and AST outputs, figure out a parser.

I'm still a bit hung up on this whole [[SetDB]] thing, but now that I'm  using cpan:Class::DBI a lot I have much less motivation to actually develop it. So perhaps I should write Class::DBI::Sets or something. Then we could use the class dbi stuff to make sets, then create new sets out of them, which would really be views. hmm... does class::dbi have views? lets see... Looks like cpan:Class::DBI::View exists, but is only good for reading, not writing.

Well the thing that I lose by using a single set class is types. You could make a set of anything, and things in the set wouldn't have to be the same type. Or would they? I could make a rule that says only things of a single type can go into a set. hm. Of course this type could be a tuple. Thats probably what the [[SetDB]] system implied previously anyway, come to think of it.

Well cpan:Class::DBI is sort of a subset of what I want. The only types of sets they allow have a one-to-one correspondence with tables.

* links secretly trigger js which alters the form's action and then POSTS the page.
* js detects a visit to a cached page, does a background GET to server to let it know and to display its results
* if a link detects that it has forked-the-window, maybe it could fork the continuation on the server?

Idea: Dots! The game where you have a grid, take turns placing lines surrounding squares. Might want to look for that book... hmm, I actually think that the math club has that one.


The overlapping concepts:
* Object-DB mapper
* HTML binding/rendering of ODB widgets
* Composing of ODB widgets
* Composing of ODB objects
* DOM-based template

Full screen degraded digital video - if you get only every nth packet you get every nth pixel. No compression? Very fine-grade...

Centralized Logic - The core happenings of a program should all be in one spot, easily readable and understandable. Web-MVC spreads things out too much.
