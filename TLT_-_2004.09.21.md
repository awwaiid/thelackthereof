I just noticed http://www.hostingsoftware.net/, which is a direct competetor to http://eggplantfarms.org's own system of custom scripts and [[EPFarms Panel]]. I'll probably go ahead and install it to see what its all about, but from the description it is definately not an abandon-ship worthy project. Sounds like there are a couple core design descisions that we decided upon differently. Interesting none the less.

I'm very excited about the new Mirabel! Pieces have already started to arrive in the mail. The only one that seems like it will be slow in getting here is the powersupply.

Time to wake up Beth.
