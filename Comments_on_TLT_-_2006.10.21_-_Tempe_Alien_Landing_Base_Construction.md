You so completely fail. You know the subject of this post is actually "People of Earth!".

Excellent timing, my friend. I just saw that today and wondered what it was.

I was so distracted when I got over the bridge on Mill and to a red light, that I started to make a right-on-red turn and had gone one foot when the light turned green and all of the pedestrians darted out into the intersection. I slammed on my brakes immediately, but everyone honked or yelled at me, and probably didn't realize that I had started going before they did.

The center for the arts is a really unusual sight. I, like you, am surprised I hadn't heard of it or seen drawings of it beforehand.

I also notice a couple of giant cranes I didn't see earlier about halfway between University and Rio Salado. Downtown Tempe sure is growing quickly.
