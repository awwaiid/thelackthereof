I'v been working for some time now on extracting some 2000 and 1990 census data. After a few failed starts, here I'll document what I've actually come up with. A bit.

== Input Data ==
Here I'll describe what I have

== 2000 Census Data ==
Describe a bit about census 2000 data format stuff.

== 1990 Census Data ==
Describe a bit about the 1990 census data format stuff.
